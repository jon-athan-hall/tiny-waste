  <p>
    This week, we took a look at the <a href="importance-of-water-conservation.html" target="__blank">importance of water conservation</a> 
    and found out that the average American family uses <a href="https://www.epa.gov/watersense/how-we-use-water" target="__blank">
    300 gallons of water every day</a> at home. According to <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/07/140729093112.htm" target="__blank">
    Science Daily</a>, research shows that we will not have enough fresh water to meet demand by 2040, if 
    changes are not made beforehand. So, here are 20 ways to cut back on water usage, which will 
    not only conserve a critical resource, but save a ton of money in the process.

  <h2>Flush less</h2>
  <p>
    Every flush of a standard, older toilet uses 7 gallons of water. Instead of flushing every time 
    you go to the restroom, follow this little rhyme "If it's brown, flush it down. If it's yellow, keep it mellow."

  <h2>Fix leaky faucets</h2>
  <p>
    According to the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/watersense/how-we-use-water" target="__blank">EPA</a>,
    leaks account for 12% of our daily water usage. The average family can waste 180 gallons per week, or 9,400 gallons of water annually, 
    from household leaks.
  </p>

  <h2>Wash fruits and vegetables in a dish</h2>
  <p>
    Fill dish with clean water to rinse fruits and vegetables instead of letting the faucet run.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Save kitchen water for house plants</h2>
  <p>
    Unsalted water from rinsing, steaming, and boiling food in the kitchen can be given a second life 
    in a watering can.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Don't rinse dishes before loading them into the dishwasher</h2>
  <p>
    Loading dishes directly into the dishwasher can save 20 gallons of water per load.
  </p>
</section>

  <h2>Turn off the faucet while scrubbing dishes</h2>
  <p>
    Letting your faucet run for five minutes while washing dishes can waste 10 gallons of water.
  </p>

  <h2>Keep your grass a little taller</h2>
  <p>
    Adjust your lawn mower to the height of 1.5 to 2 inches. Taller grass shades roots and holds 
    soil moisture better than short grass.
  </p>

<section>
  <h2>Don't bag your law clippings</h2>
  <p>
    Leave lawn clippings on your grass, this cools the ground and holds in moisture.

  <h2>Spread mulch in your garden beds</h2>
  <p>
    Spreading a layer of organic mulch around plants both prevents weeds and
    helps them retain moisture, saving water, time and money.
