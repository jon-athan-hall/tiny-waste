  <p>
    I started my period in junior high, right in the middle of a week long summer soccer camp. I vividly remember 
    standing in the porta potty, devastated that my time had come, and having to wait until the end of the day 
    until I could learn to insert my first of many tampons. I can clearly picture the boxes upon boxes of feminine hygiene products 
    my family of three women kept in the house at all times and I can't but cringe, knowing that every bit of it ended up 
    in a landfill.

  <p>
    We're all aware that half the population has to, will have to, or used to deal with monthly menstruation. 
    On average, women get a period for <a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/menstrual-cycle/your-menstrual-cycle/" target="__blank">
    40 years</a>. That's about 450 periods per woman and as <a href="https://zerowastememoirs.com/zero-waste-period/" target="__blank">
    some estimates</a> show, a total of nearly six years of our lives are spent menstruting. In fact, the 
    average woman uses about <a href="https://zerowastememoirs.com/zero-waste-period/" target="__blank">9,600 tampons in her 
    lifetime. That's a lot of garbage.

  <h4>What's the problem with feminine hygiene products?</h4>
  <p>
    You're probably already aware that the vast majority of tampons come with a plastic wrapper and plastic applicator. 
    However, it may surprise you to know that the tampon itself as well as the string, are often 
    made with a mixture of <a hreef="https://tampax.com/en-us/about/ingredients/what-tampons-are-made-of/" target="__blank">
    cotton and synthetic</a> (aka plastic) material. Tampons aren't the only guilty party, as pads are also lined 
    with plastic. In total, <a href="https://digital.hbs.edu/platform-rctom/submission/the-ecological-impact-of-feminine-hygiene-products/" target="__blank">
    20 billion</a> tampons, pads, and applicators end up North American landfills every year.
  </p>

  <p>
    As mentioned in previous weeks, disposable plastics are harmful for the environment because they take 
    hundreds of years to break down. Feminine hygiene products are particularly bad since their small size 
    makes them more likely to fall through the cracks and end up in our oceans and waterways.

  <h4>Are tampons applicators recyclable?</h4>
  <p>
    Technically, the plastic applicator from a tampon could probably be recycled, but they aren't typically 
    accepted by curbside pickup for sanitary reasons.

  <h4>Can I compost tampons after use?</h4>
  <p>
    You can compost used tampons that are made from 100% natural material and are labeled as "biodegradable". 
    However, while most brands have cotton inserts, they also have synthetic material mixed in to the tampon and the string, so they 
    shouldn't go in your compost. If you do end up composting, be warned; cotton will take a long time to break down in your home compost.

  <h4>What are my options for more sustainable feminine hygiene products?</h4>
  <p>
    You can ditch conventional pads and tampons and switch to reusable products like menstrual cups and 
    <a href="make-reusable-pads.html" target="__blank">cloth panty liners</a>. For a full list of options,
