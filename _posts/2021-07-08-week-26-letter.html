    This week, I learned how much of an impact global warming is having on our water supply as well as <a href="importance-of-water-conservation.html" target="__blank">
    the importance of water conservation</a>. In an effort to cut back on my own water usage, 
    I found multiple ways to <a href="how-to-conserve-water.html" target="__blank">conserve water at 
    home</a>. However, the global water shortage is a much bigger problem than we individuals can 
    solve at home. That's why this week's letter is going out to my local government representatives. 
    Use this template to request that our government acknowledge and act on climate change and its 
    affect on our nation's water supply.

    I used parts of a letter from <a href="http://www.global-greenhouse-warming.com/climate-change-letter.html" target="__blank">global-greenhouse-warming.com</a>, 
    with a few revisions to specifically target the global water shortage crisis.

  <p>
    Dear [government official],
  </p>

  <p>
    I am writing to express my concern about climate change and the imminent threat it poses to 
    our country. The overwhelming majority of scientists agree that global warming is real and that 
    it is approaching at a much quicker rate than initially predicted and changes must be made immediately. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Specifically, I'd like to address the global water shortage. Scientists have warned that in the United States, we could see our freshwater supply reduced by as 
    much as a third within the next 50 years. And since 40 out of our 50 states are expecting water 
    shortages, it's time to start conserving water and preparing for the future.
  </p>

  <p>
    I believe you should act to address the issues below, and I ask you to 
    provide me with information on what the government is doing to reduce greenhouse gas 
    emissions in the following areas:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Educate to change consumption and lifestyles.</li>
    <li>Improve irrigation and agricultural practices.</li>
    <li>Develop energy efficient desalination plants.</li>
    <li>Improve water catchment and harvesting.</li>
    <li>Shrink corporate water footprints.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    With my first child due in October, I find these issues more daunting than ever and I believe it 
    is our moral responsibility to secure a future for our nation and the next generation. I understand that focusing 
    on climate change and the global water shortage is just one of many issues during these challenging times. 
    However, we cannot wait until tomorrow we must take strong action now to address the daunting issues that 
    climate change poses.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sincerely,
  </p>
