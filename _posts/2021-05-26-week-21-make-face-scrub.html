  <p>
    Our skin care routine can be complex and expensive. Before trying to shrink my waste, I was spending hundreds 
    of dollars every few months on teeny tiny bottles of cleanser, scrub, and moisturizer. Now, 
    I look to other bloggers for natural recipes that I can make with ingredient I already have at home. 
    I'm ruducing both my waste and my spending by making all of my skin care products instead of buying them.

  <h2>Awakening Coffee Face Scrub</h2>
  {% include image-source-set.html image="21-face-wash/diy-scrub.jpg" alt="" %}
  <p>
    <a href="https://islandbeauty.co/blog/face-care/diy-homemade-coffee-face-scrub/" target="__blank">Island Beauty</a> 
    has loads of natural self care recipes, but I love this coffee scrub because it uses coffee grounds, 
    which would normally end up in the garbage! This recipe calls for coconut oil, but I've used olive oil 
    instead and had the same results.
  </p>
  <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1/4 cup coffee grounds</li>
    <li>1/8 cup brown sugar</li>
    <li>1/4 cup coconut oil</li>
    <li>10 drops frankincense essential oil</li>
  </ul>
   
  <h3>Instructions:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>In a double boiler, slightly melt the coconut oil on low heat.</li>
    <li>Once melted, add brown sugar, coffee grounds, and frankincense essential oil and thoroughly mix it.</li>
    <li>Transfer the coffee face scrub to a Mason jar and seal.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>How to use:</h3>
  <p>
    Using your fingers, apply the scrub to your face and gently massage. When you're ready, rinse and pat dry.
    According to the Island Beauty blog, this recipe does not have a shelf life and should be used immediately.

    5 Kitchen Ingredients that Make Excellent Moisturizers</a>. Olive oil may be all you need, 
    but if you're looking for a more traditional recipe, try this one from <a href="https://www.ouroilyhouse.com/natural-face-moisturizer-recipe/" target="__blank">
    Our Oily House</a>. I especially love that this post provides information on which essentials oils 
    will be best for your skin type.

    <li>1 tbsp jojoba oil</li>

    <li>15 drops essential oil</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Instructions:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Add shea butter, jojoba oil, and coconut oil to a glass bowl.</li>
    <li>Set the glass bowl over a pot of boiling water to create a double boiler. Melt all ingredients together.</li>
    <li>Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly.</li>
    <li>Add in essential oils, stir together well.</li>
    <li>Store in an airtight container.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h3>How to use:</h3>
  <p>
    To use, add a dime size amount to hand and apply to your face. If stored at roomtemp in an airtight container, 
    this moisturizer will stay good for one year.
