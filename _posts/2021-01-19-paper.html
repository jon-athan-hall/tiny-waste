    It's going to take a few months for that junk mail to stop taking over my mailbox.  Until then, I'm going to 
    use it to make some cute paper.
</p>

<section>
  <h2>What you'll need:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Junk mail</li>
    <li>Window screen or flat strainer - I use an actual full window screen that I found in my garage. 
      You can use the screen from an busted old window and staple it to a picture frame. A large
      flat kitchen strainer woul also work, but will produce smaller round pieces of paper.
    </li>
    <li>Blender - you can usually find a cheap used one at second hand shops.</li>
    <li>Water catch - a tub or baking sheet that is ideally bigger than your screen.</li>
    <li>Towel - for blotting excess water.</li>
    <li>Scoop or spoon - completely optional, your hands will work just as well. </li>
    <li>Flower petals and leaves - also optional. You can add any kind of flair to your paper or none at all.</li>
  </ul>

      <img src="assets/posts/junk-mail/gather-junk-mail.jpg" alt="box of junk mail">
      <p>
        1. Gather you junk mail. You can use old bills, coupons, magazines, advertisements, 
        credit card offers (minus the plastic credit card).
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <img src="assets/posts/junk-mail/2-remove-plastic-windows.jpg" alt="hands removing platic window from envelope">
      <p>
        2. Remove all of the plastic windows from envelopes.
      </p>
    </li>

      <img src="assets/posts/junk-mail/3-rip-paper.jpg" alt="hands ripping paper near blender full of shredded paper">
      <p>
        3. Shred or rip up the paper into small pieces and put them in a blender. Fill to top.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <img src="assets/posts/junk-mail/4-fill-with-water.jpg" alt="hands pouring water from bottle into blender">
      <p>
        4. Pour water in the blender, just enough to cover the paper strips.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <img src="assets/posts/junk-mail/5-blend.jpg" alt="overhead view of paper pulp in blender">
      <p>
        5. Blend until paper becomes a mushy pulp and all large pieces are gone.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <img src="assets/posts/junk-mail/6-water-catch.jpg" alt="plastic storage bin lid being placed under window screen">
      <p>
        6. Set your screen over something to catch the excess water. I used the lid of plastic storage bin.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <img src="assets/posts/junk-mail/7-add-flowers.jpg" alt="flower petals and leaves being put on window screen">
      <p>
        7. This is an optional step, but if you would like to add a little extra flair, now is the time to do it. 
        You can put flower petals, leaves, or whatever you want to expirement with directly on the screen.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <img src="assets/posts/junk-mail/8-scooplap.jpg" alt="hands scooping paper pulp from blender and plopping it on the screen">
      <p>
        8. Scoop the paper pulp out of the blender and plop it on your screen. I used a small kitchen strainer so that
        I could leave some of the water behind.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <img src="assets/posts/junk-mail/9-spread-and-dry.jpg" alt="paper pulp spread out on screen and hand patting it dry with towel">
      <p>
        9. Spread the pulp out on the screen as thin as you can without creating holes. Use a towel to pat the pulp
        and soak up excess water. Leave it to dry. 
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <img src="assets/posts/junk-mail/10-peel-off-screen.jpg" alt="dried paper removed from screen">
      <p>
        10. Once the paper is completely dry, which might take a few days, slowly and carefully peel it off of the screen.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <img src="assets/posts/junk-mail/11-fold-and-tear.jpg" alt="hands folding the paper">
      <p>
        11. Cut the paper into desired size. I like the look of the rough edges, so instead of using scissors, I simply
        fold the paper and carefully pull it apart at the fold.
      </p>

        12. You can use this paper to make cards, to-do lists, labels...be creative!
