    In 2008, <a href="https://resource.co/article/Packaging/Wasted_beauty_Packaging_cosmetics_industry" target="__blank">
    Euromonitor</a> reported the cosmetics industry created 120.8 billion units of packaging. 
    Over the last few weeks, we've found sustainable alternatives for <a href="environmental-impact-of-lotion.html" target="__blank">

  <h2>Why are hair care products a problem?</h2>
  <p>
    Over <a href="https://www.elitedaily.com/p/lush-shampoo-bars-are-one-of-the-easiest-ways-to-reduce-plastic-waste-9396702" target="__blank">
    552 million shampoo bottles</a> are thrown away every year and as you know, they are almost exclusively 
    plastic. Plastics are problematic because they are made from non-renewable resources, have limited 
    recyclability, and take hundreds if not thousands of years to break down. 
  </p>

  <h3>Shampoo and Conditioner</h3>
  <p>
    Shampoo and conditioner bottles, like all plastics, are made from crude oil, a non-renewable resource, which is harmful for two reasons: 
    manufacturing generates significant pollution and the product is not biodegradable. 
    As <a href="https://sciencing.com/why-are-plastic-bags-so-bad-for-the-environment-5005999.html" target="__blank">Sciencing.com</a>
    put it, "they are difficult to produce and nearly impossible to get rid of once produced". Instead of biodegrading, 
    plastic breaks down into tiny micro-plastics that litter our soil, our waterways, and even our air. 
  </p>

  <h3>Hairspray</h3>
  <p>
    Aerosol hairspray, while usually sold in aluminum or steel spray cans, bring a different kind of 
    environmental issue. According to <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/are-aerosols-still-bad/" target="__blank">
    ScientificAmerican.com</a>, "they still contain hydrocarbons and/or compressed gases notorious for their contribution to global warming."
    These aerosols emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that contribute to ground-level ozone levels, a key component of smog.

  <h2>Are there any harmful ingredients in my hair care products?</h2>
  <p>
    As with many other cosmetics, there are a few ingredients in conventional hair care products 
    that can be bad for both our health and the environment. Here are a few to look out for:
  </p>

  <h3>Parabens</h3>
  <p>
    Parabens, which are <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/should-people-be-concerned-about-parabens-in-beauty-products/" target="__blank">
    synthetic compounds used as preservatives</a>, have been linked to 
    <a href="https://www.prevention.com/beauty/a20507577/harmful-ingredients-in-body-lotion/" target="__blank">
    hormone disruption, reproductive issues, and breast cancer</a>. Most cosmetics use a such small amounts that 
    the FDA official stance claims there is no reason for consumers to worry, however, in my opinion, it's not 
    worth the potential risk. On top of that, <a href="https://www.ewg.org/what-are-parabens" target="__blank">studies have shown</a>
    that they can be devastating to coral reefs.
  </p>

  <p>
    The six most common parabens to look out for are: methylparaben, ethylparaben, isobutylparaben, propylparaben, benzylparaben, butylparaben.
  </p>

  <h3>Pthalates</h3>
  <p>
    Pthalates are used as softeners in cosmetics, lubricating oils, childrens toys, and vinyl flooring. 
    The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/biomonitoring/Phthalates_FactSheet.html" target="__blank">CDC</a> has 
    found measurable amounts of pthalate metabolites in the general population. 
    Some pthalates have been proven to affect reproductivity in animals, while others have been 
    banned from children's due to their toxicity. However, since there is not enough research to conclude long 
    term affects in humans, many pthalates are merely on the EPA's "Chemicals of Concern" list. 
  </p>

  <h3>Formaldehyde</h3>
  <p>
    Yes, that stinky stuff from your frog dissecting science class can be found as a smoothing 
    agent in some hair care products. According to <a href="https://www.osha.gov/hair-salons" target="__blank">
    OSHA</a> formaldehyde (also known as methyl adelhyde, methylene oxide, oxymethylene, and 
    oxomethane) is a known cancer causing substance. 
  </p>

  <h2>Are hair care product containers recyclable?</h2>
  <p>
    Typically, plastic hair care bottles are made from #1 and #2 plastics, which means they are often 
    accepted in most curbside recycling programs. Look for the number inside the recycling symbol to determine 
    if it is withing local requirements. Aerosol hairspray cans, though typically made of aluminum or 
    steel, may or may not be accepted. If they are, make sure you've emptied the can before tossing it 
    in the bin.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If any of these bottles cannot be recycled in your town, you can print out a free shipping label and send them to <a href="https://www.terracycle.com/en-US/brigades/garnier#@40.77027075200147:-95.93705549677736zoom:4" target="__blank">
    Terracycle</a> via a program sponsored by Garnier. Or, you can drop them off for recycling 
    at participating <a href="https://www.terracycle.com/en-US/brigades/nordstrom#@40.77027075200147:-95.93705549677736zoom:4" target="__blank">
    Nordstrom stores</a>.
