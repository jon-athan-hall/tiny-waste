    Mouthwash bottles are typically made of #1 plastics, which are generally curbside recyclable. 
    However, since the EPA has reported that a mere 8% of plastics are actually recycled, it's best to 
    avoid plastics where we can. This week's letter asks leading mouthwash brand, Listerine, to take 
    steps towards eliminating plastic from their bottles.

    Good afteroon,
  </p> 

  <p>
    My name is Ali Hall. I grew up watching my father use Listerine mouthwash every morning and now, 
    I am a 34 year old woman who has been following his routine for decades.

    This year, I resolved to reduce my waste contribution and one of my most frequent sources of bathroom 
    waste are your plastic mouthwash bottles. I realize that they are made of #1 plastic, which is typically 
    curbside recyclable, however, I recently read a report from the EPA stating that a mere 8% of 
    plastic is actually recycled. This means that 92% of plastic is ending up in or waterways or landfills, 
    where it takes hundreds of years to break down. Not to mention the amount of pollutants contaminating our air 
    from plastic production alone.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm writing to request that you phase out the plastic bottles and switch to a more sustainable alternative, 
    like aluminum, which is infinitely recyclable. Georganics and Colgate both offer mouthwash in 
    aluminum bottles, so I know that this is not an impossible switch.
  </p>

  <p>
    It's no secret that plastics have become increasingly problematic and our earth is suffering from 
    the exorbitant amount of waste produced by humans. More and more people are becoming aware of these 
    issues and working towards a brighter, cleaner future for the next generation, so I'm certain 
    your consumers would be thrilled to see Listerine take a stand in protecting our environment.

    Thank you for you time,
  </p>

  <p>
    Ali Hall
