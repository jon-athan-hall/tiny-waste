  <p>
    Last week, I learned about the <a href="" target="__blank">environmental impact of food waste</a> and 
    how throwing away food not only wastes resources, but also produces methane gases when sent to a landfill.
    I implemented a few <a href="15-ways-to-reduce-food-waste.html" target="__blank">small changes</a> 
    to reduce my contribution and found ways to <a href="10-ways-to-reuse-food-scraps.html" target="__blank">reuse food scraps</a>, but there 
    is always some food waste left to deal with. So, this week, I'll start composting.
