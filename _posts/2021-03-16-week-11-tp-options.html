    Looking for a few ways to make your ones and twos a little more sustainable? Here are four options
    to consider.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Recycled Paper</h2>
  <p>
    According to <a href="http://www.toiletpaperhistory.net/toilet-paper-made/recycled-toilet-paper/" target="__blank">
    ToiletPaperHistory.net</a>, "If every American household replaced just one toilet paper roll of virgin-fiber a year 
    with a roll made from 100% recycled paper, approximately 425,000 trees would be saved annually." 
  </p>
      
  <p>
    What you're looking for is 80-100% post-consumer recycled content. Pre-consumer uses the 
    pulp scraps left over from paper making, while post-consumer content is collected vie recycled 
    paper waste. Many grocery stores carry Seventh Generation, while Whole Foods and Trader Joes both 
    offer their own brands of recycled toilet paper. My favorite, and the brand with the highest environmental 
    grade is <a href="https://us.whogivesacrap.org/" target="__blank">Who Gives A Crap</a>, which has 
    the best price per roll and offers a subscription delivery service. A few added bonuses: their deliveries 
    are completely plastic free, 50% of profits go towards building new toilets aruond the world, and each roll comes wrapped in adorable patterned paper that is great for crafting.

  <h2>Bamboo</h2>
  <p>
    Bamboo is one of the fastest growing plants on earth, so it's no wonder why it has become a 
    popular sustainable alternative for wood and paper products. In addition to growing quickly, bamboo 
    products produce <a href="https://www.treehugger.com/eco-friendly-toilet-paper-bamboo-vs-recycled-5114452" target="__blank">
    30% fewer greenhouse emissions</a> than those made of virgin pulp.
  </p>

  <p>
    I've seen bamboo toilet paper options in Target, but for better prices, look into getting a subscription from 
    <a href="https://us.whogivesacrap.org/" target="__blank">Who Gives A Crap</a> or <a href="https://reelpaper.com/?utm_source=bing&utm_medium=Paid&utm_campaign=reelbranded&msclkid=9f427acbe0291a3337bf1a80015dc3c9" target="__blank">
    Reel</a>.

  <h2>Bidet</h2>
  <p>
    Bidets have been around since the 1700s, but never got too popular in the USA. 
    You can install a bidet on any toilet and clean your bottom without using any 
    or much less toilet paper, saving both paper and money. Think of it this way, 
    if you got feces on your hand, you wouldn't just wipe it off with paper, you would wash it off.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are plenty of inexpensive bidet options out there that you could try without breaking the bank. 
    My husband and I have been discussing the bidet for months and finally invested in a 
    <a href="https://hellotushy.com/" target="__blank">Tushy</a> bidet attachment. I'll be sure to write
    a review once we've had some practice.
  </p>

  <h2>Cloth</h2>
  <p>
    Before you completely rule out reusable cloth toilet paper, let me talk you through how it works. 
    You keep a basket of cloth wipes on or near the toilet, use a wipe every time you use the restroom, and throw 
    that wipe into a bucket or wet bag until wash day. I was initially grossed out by the idea, but 
    we are going to try a cloth/bidet combo and see how it goes.
