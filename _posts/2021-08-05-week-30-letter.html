    This week, I started breaking down my household cleaning routine, starting in the bathroom. 
    <a href="environmental-impact-of-bathroom-cleaners.html" target="__blank">Bathroom cleaners</a> 
    pollute our air and our waterways, while contributing waste from their plastic packaging. While 
    there are <a href="sustainable-bathroom-cleaners.html" target="__blank">sustainable bathroom cleaners</a>
    on the market, I think it's important to hold larger companies accountable for their environmental impact.<!--more--> 
    So, I'm writing to Scrubbing Bubbles, a leading brand in bathroom cleaners, asking that they offer products made of 
    cleaner ingredients and begin to phase out plastic bottles.

<section class="letter">
  <p>
    Good afternoon,
  </p>

  <p>
    My name is Ali and I've been using Scrubbing Bubbles products for as long as I can remember. Your 
    bathroom cleaners always leave my tubs and toilets bright and sparkling. 
  </p>

  <p>
    This year, I made a resolution to reduce my carbon footprint by making gradual changes. And now that I 
    have a baby coming in October, I'm especially concerned about keeping the planet safe for future generations. 
    This week, I started looking into my household cleaning products and noticed that they mostly come in plastic 
    bottles and are full of harsh chemicals that are toxic for me and could cause significant harm to aquatic 
    life when washed down the drain and into our waterways. 
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm writing to see if you'll consider making a bathroom cleaner from naturally-derived ingredients that are 
    safer for both our health and the environment. In addition, I would love to see you phase out plastic bottles. 
    I know that Scrubbing Bubbles bottles are recyclable. However, that feels like a temporary solution, 
    since only 8% of plastics are actually recycled.  The rest end up in landfills, where they will take 
    hundreds of years to decompose, or in our waterways, where they break down into microplastics that 
    cause 100,000 marine animal deaths every year. In fact, it’s estimated that by 2050, there will be more 
    plastic in the ocean than fish. Not to mention the manufacturing of plastic 
    uses oil and causes pollution.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m aware that nothing can happen overnight, but at least working towards eliminating plastics 
    would be a huge step in the right direction. Perhaps you could look into packaging your products 
    in refillable aluminum or glass bottles. You might also consider moving towards bathroom cleaner 
    powders or tablets that can be sold in compostable paperboard packaging.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It's no secret that plastics have become increasingly problematic and our earth is suffering 
    from the exorbitant amount of waste produced by humans. More and more people are becoming aware 
    of these issues and working towards a brighter, cleaner future for the next generation.
    I'm sure your consumers would be thrilled to see Scrubbing Bubbles take such a strong approach to reducing 
    waste and protecting our planet. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Sincerely,
  </p>

  <p>
