    It doesn't take much to make your own hankie and by keeping one on you, you'll have no need 
    to waste a paper napkin when you're out and about. Note: this tutorial is only for the napkin itself, 
    not a lesson on embroidery.

      <p>
        1. Grab your fabric. I used a stained linen pillowcase that my sister was getting rid of.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <img src="assets/posts/8-napkins/2-cut-square.jpg" alt="cut square of linen fabric">
      <p>
        2. Cut out a square. You can make it any size you like, but I cut out 12" x 12" and found it 
        to be perfect.
      </p>
    </li>

      <img src="assets/posts/8-napkins/3-diagonal-square.jpg" alt="linen fabric folded on the diagonal">

        3. You can fold your square diagonally to make sure it is a nice even square.

        5. Snip off a small triangle from each corner. See picture.

      <p>
        7. Fold each edge over a quarter of an inch and pin in place. Corners should meet at a clean 45 degree seam.
      </p>
    </li>

        9. Sew down all four sides by hand or machine. You should be able to use the edge of the sewing machine foot 
        as a guide. 
      </p>
