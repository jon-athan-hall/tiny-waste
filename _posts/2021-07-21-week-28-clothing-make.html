  <p>
    This week, I took a look at <a href="environmental-impact-of-fast-fashion.html" target="__blank">
    the environmental impact of fast fashion</a> and learned that one of the best ways to have 
    sustainable closet is to <a href="where-to-find-secondhand-clothing.html" target="__blank">
    shop secondhand</a>. Secondhand clothes shopping can be a little daunting, especially when things don't fit exactly right. 
    However, there are a few extremely easy alterations that can make your thrift finds feel like tailored garments.
  </p>

  <p>
    These are all easy fixes to common problems, but if you're not too handy with a needle and thread, 
    look for a tailor to take care of it for you. If you are having trouble finding a tailor in your area, 
    check with your local dry cleaner to see if they offer alteration services. They usually do quick, quality, 
    and affordable work.
