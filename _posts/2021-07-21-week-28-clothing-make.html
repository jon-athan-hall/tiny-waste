    Secondhand clothes shopping can be a little daunting, especially when things don't fit exactly right. 
    However, there are a few extremely easy alterations that can make your thrift finds 
  </p>

  <p>
    These are all easy fixes to common problems, but if you're not too handy with a needle and thread, 
    look for a tailor to take care of it for you. If you are having trouble finding a tailor in your area, check with your local dry cleaner to 
    see if they offer alteration services. They usually do quick, quality, and inexpensive work.
