  <p>
    I chose Curbside Recycling for the first week of my Tiny Waste Resolution because it takes a significant chunk out 
    of my landfill contribution, but it seems easy enough to implement without making me want to quit within the 
    first week. <!--more-->Most zero wasters claim that recycling should be a last resort, which is understandable since
    only 9% of plastic actually gets recycled. Hopefully, by the end of the year, even my recycling bins will be low,
     but in the mean time, I want to make sure I’m not just <a href="/week-1-wishful-recycling.html" target="_blank">wishful recycling</a>, 
     which can do more harm than good.

    According to the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/recycle/recycling-basics" target="_blank">EPA</a>, recycling can be beneficial 
    for multiple reasons:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Reduces the amount of waste sent to landfills and incinerators</li>
    <li>Conserves natural resources such as timber, water and minerals</li>
    <li>Increases economic security by tapping a domestic source of materials</li>
    <li>Prevents pollution by reducing the need to collect new raw materials</li>
    <li>Saves energy</li>
    <li>Supports American manufacturing and conserves valuable resources</li>
    <li>Helps create jobs in the recycling and manufacturing industries in the United States</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    So where do I begin?

  <h2>Find out my local options</h2> 
  <p>
    To get started, I searched the internet to see if my area offers a recycling 
    program. Fortunately, it does! A quick search for “Radnor Township recycling” brought me to the city’s trash 
    and refuse web page, where I found a pick up calendar, guidelines and list of acceptable contributions. You
    can also enter your zipcode at <a href="https://berecycled.org/" target="_blank">berecycled.org</a> to find 
    recycling options in your area. As of 2019, about half of the country has access to curbside recycling. 
    If your area does not offer a recycling program, why not write a letter requesting one!

  <h2>Set up easy to understand recycling bins</h2>

    Even though my township has single stream recycling, I want to make sure that everyone using my recycling 
    bins understands exactly what can be recycled. <a href="recycling-bins.html" target="_blank">Click here</a> to see how I set up my recycling bins.

  <h2>Stop Wishful Recycling</h2>
  <p>
    The sad thing is, I thought I was already a recycling queen! For the last decade, I’ve been giving myself a 
    pat on the back for every garbage bag of milk cartons and water bottles I brought to the curb over the past 
    decade. Unfortunately, I did the bare minimum and would be willing to guess that the majority of my discard 
    ended up in a landfill. For example, I didn’t really clean anything and I tossed ALL plastic in without 
    checking to see if it was accepted. Sadly, <a href="week-1-wishful-recycling.html" target="_blank">wishful recycling</a> is a pretty major problem here in 
    U.S., but if we continue to educate ourselves and eachother, we can change that.
