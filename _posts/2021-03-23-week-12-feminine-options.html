   A woman has, on average, about 450 periods in her lifetime, the average woman using about 
   <a href="https://zerowastememoirs.com/zero-waste-period/" target="__blank">9,600 tampons</a>. 
   This is both an enourmous amount of period waste sent to landfills, and a hefty amount of cash 
   spent on single-use items. Here are five sustainable alternatives to keep your trash can empty and 
   your bank account full.

        A menstrual cup is inserted similar to a tampon, but instead of absorbing, 
        it collects the blood until you take it out to empty and clean. Most cups can be left in around 10-12 hours, but 
        varies based on your individual cycle. Menstrual cups range from $10-$30 and can be used for up to 10 years or until 
        it shows visible signs of wear and tear.

        As with any hygiene product, you may have to do some expirementing to see which works best for you.

      <p>
        A cloth pad works exactly like a regular pad, except instead of sticking it to your underwear, you snap 
        or button it closed. And instead of throwing it in the trash after you use, you can wash and reuse it.

      <p>
        Period underwear are worn like regular panties, but with the added benefit of absorbing one to four tampons 
        worth of menstruation. It may sound too good to be true, but I've heard many first hand accounts of success without having to use 
        any other feminine hygiene products. Period underwear ranges from $20-$50, but can be washed and worn 
        for years. Some companies even offer absorbant clothing options. Popular brands include <a href="https://www.shethinx.com/collections/thinx-shop-all" target="__blank">Thinx</a>,

      <p>
        If your desperate to stick with what you know, give biodegradable tampons a try. 
        They might still come with plastic wrapping, but there are a few options that are 100% cotton 
        and ditch the plastic applicator. Popular brands include <a href="https://www.ob-tampons.com/product-details/procomfortregular" target="__blank">

        If you've opted for biodegradable tampons, but miss the applicator, you can get a reusable one.
        A reusable applicator is simply a case that fits any size tampon to make insertion a little easier.
