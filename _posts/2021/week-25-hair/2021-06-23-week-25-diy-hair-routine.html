  <p>
    This week, to help shrink my waste, I started looking for low-waste hair care products. I made a list of 
    <a href="sustainable-hair-care-options.html" target="__blank">10 sustainable brands</a> that are both 
    plastic-free and made with environmentally friendly ingredients. But I also found a few great DIY recipes from fellow 
    bloggers that I want to share. 
  </p>
  <p>
    These are all extremely easy and a great option for anyone looking to spend less on their hair care routine.

  </a>

  <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 cup shea butter</li>
    <li>1 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vitamin e oil</li>
    <li>Optional: 30 drops rosemary essential oils</li>

  <ol>
    <li>Make a double boiler by adding a few inches of water in a large saucepan. Heat the pan on low flame.</li>
    <li>In a glass bowl, combine the olive oil, shea butter and place the glass bowl on top of a saucepan. Stir occasionally until everything is melted and combined.</li>

  <h2>Hair Gel - Hair Buddha</h2>
  <a href="https://www.hairbuddha.net/hair-styling-gel/" target="__blank" class="border:none">
    {% include image-source-set.html image="25-hair/hair-buddha-gel.jpg" alt="glass jar with clear gel" %}
  </a>
  
  <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1/4 cup flaxseeds</li>
    <li>2 cups water</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Instructions:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Place flaxseeds and water in a pot and bring to a boil. You will notice white froth on the top.</li>
    <li>Now reduce the flame and let it simmer for 5 to 7 minutes. During this time, you need to stir it constantly. While you are doing this, you will see the water turn to a gel-like consistency.</li>
    <li>The best way to check if your gel is ready is to do a spoon test. Dip the spoon into the cooking gel and watch it drop back into the pan. If it drops too quickly, it needs some more cooking. When the gel starts to run off the spoon in a string form, then it’s done.</li>
    <li>Strain with a steel strainer while it’s still hot (use the back of a spoon to press the gel out of the seeds as best as you can). The gel will get thicker as it cools down.</li> 
  </ol>
