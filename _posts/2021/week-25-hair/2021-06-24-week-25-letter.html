    This week I learned about <a href="environmental-impact-of-hair-products.html" target="__blank">the environmental impact of hair products</a> 
    and how both the plastic packaging and some synthetic ingredients are problematic. I made a list of <a href="sustainable-hair-care-options.html" target="__blank">
    sustainable makeup brands</a>, but there are still plenty of companies that need us consumers to ask for change. 
    So, this week's letter requests that my favorite shampoo brand, DevaCurl, phase out plastics and offer low-waste 
    hair care product options. Use this template to write to your favorite hair care brand.

  Good afternoon,
  </p>
  
  <p>
  My name is Ali and I've been using DevaCurl products for over a decade. Your No-Poo, One Condition, and Angel, 
  were the first products that made me love my curls. This year, I’m making a conscious change to reduce my 
  carbon footprint and I’ve started to notice how much waste I’ve been contributing to our 
  earth. This includes waste from your plastic hair care bottles.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  I’m writing to see if you’ll consider making a more environmentally friendly makeup.  I know 
  that many of your bottles are recyclable, but that feels like a temporary solution since the EPA has reported that only 8% of plastics are 
  actually recycled. The rest end up in landfills, where they will take hundreds of years to break down, 
  or in our waterways, where they break down into microplastics that cause 100,000 marine animal deaths every year. In fact, 
  it’s estimated that by 2050, there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish. Not to mention the manufacturing of plastic 
  uses oil and causes pollution.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  I’m aware that nothing can happen overnight, but at least working towards phasing out plastics 
  would be a huge step in the right direction. Perhaps you could look into packaging your products with 
  in infinitely recyclable glass jars or metal bottles.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  It's no secret that plastics have become increasingly problematic and our earth is suffering 
  from the exorbitant amount of waste produced by humans. More and more people are becoming aware 
  of these issues and working towards a brighter, cleaner future for the next generation, so 
  I'm certain your consumers would be thrilled to see DevaCurl take a stand in reducing waste and
  protecting our environment.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  Thank you for your time,
  </p>
  
  <p>
