    I know what you're thinking, "reusable toilet paper sounds disgusting, I'll pass". That is 
    the exact same sentiment I had, until I looked into it a little more. For some reason, I imagined 
    my husband and I using the same dirty wipe over and over again for days at a time... which is not 
    at all the reality of the situation.
  </p>
    
  <p>
    Cloth wipes not only reduce the amount of resources needed to make toilet paper, they also save a 
    ton of money since they can be washed and reused for years. This week, we started using cloth wipes 
    in addition to a bidet, to reduce the ick factor.

  <p>
    Let me just add that you do you not have to invest a ton of time in reusable toilet paper. You could 
    easily cut some cloth strips and try it out before you make anything nicer.

  <h2>How to use cloth toilet paper</h2>
  <p>
    Cloth toilet paper is pretty straight forward. All you have to do is keep a basket or roll of cloth strips 
    next to your toilet and wipe normally. Instead of flushing, you'll put the cloth into a wet bag or lidded bucket/trash can 
    until wash day. Dry with high heat or line dry in the sun.

  <h2>What you'll need</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Flannel Fabric - It doesn't have to be flannel, but I like a soft, natural fiber on my bum. I used a pair of torn pajama pants.</li>
    <li>Scissors</li>
    <li>Serger, sewing machine, or pinking sheers to finish edges. If you've been thinking about getting a serger, 
      this is the perfect project to learn with.
    </li>
  </ul>

      {% include image-source-set.html image="11-toilet-paper/1-pajama-pants.jpg" alt="fold pair of red flannel pajama pants" %}
      <p>
        Grab a pair of worn out pajama pants. These were too ripped to donate, but perfect for this projeect.
      </p>
    </li>

      {% include image-source-set.html image="11-toilet-paper/2-measure.jpg" alt="pang leg cut to size of cardboard toilet paper roll" %}

        Use cardboard toilet paper roll to measure the width of your strips.

    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="11-toilet-paper/5-rectangles.jpg" alt="8 flannel rectangles" %}
      <p>
        I only did part one pant leg for this tutorial and ended up with eight wipes. 
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="11-toilet-paper/6-serge-edges.jpg" alt="hand serging fabric edges" %}
      <p>
        Finish off the edges with a serger or zig zag stich on the sewing machine. 
        You can also use pinking sheers if that's all you've got.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="11-toilet-paper/7-lay-strips.jpg" alt="flannel strips lined up and overlapping" %}
      <p>
        Lay your finished strips down in a row so that they overlap about halfway.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="11-toilet-paper/8-roll-strips.jpg" alt="flannel strips being rolled onto cardboard toilet paper roll" %}
      <p>
        Roll the strips onto your toilet paper roll, starting with end of the top most strip. 
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="11-toilet-paper/9-cloth-tp.jpg" alt="roll of cloth toilet paper in front of toilet" %}
      <p>
        The flannel should have no problem sticking to itself so your cloth strips can be used 
        just like normal toilet paper.
