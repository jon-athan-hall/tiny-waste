  <p>
    There are plenty of  <a href="tp-options.html" target="__blank">sustainable toilet paper options</a>, 
    but they may not be readily available at your local grocery store. That's why, this week, we'll 
    ask our go-to shop to carry a new product.
  </p>

  <p>
    Instead of or in addition to writing a letter, you can ask in person, by speaking to manager or even reaching 
    out on social media. Most grocery stores have a contact form on their websites, but 
    <a href="https://www.theproducemoms.com/2020/02/29/how-to-request-products-at-grocery-stores/" target="__blank">
    The Produce Moms</a> have conveniently put contact information for the top chains in a list for you.

  <p>
    Good afternoon,
  </p>

  <p>
    My name is Ali Hall and I frequent your Market Basket location a minimum of twice a week. It is clean, convenient, 
    and always well stocked. 
  </p> 
    
  <p>
    This year, I've become more aware of the environment and my personal impact on it, 
    so I've been switching to more sustainable products. In particular, toilet paper. Market Basket has such a great 
    selection of the top brands, but none of them are environmentally friendly since they all use virgin pulp 
    instead of recycled material.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm wondering if you would add a brand like Seventh Generation, which is made of 100% recycled material,
    to your selection. I'd be grateful that I don't have to depend on a subscription service for sustainable toilet paper and 
    I'm certain fellow patrons would appreciate your commitment to the environment.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank you,
  </p>

  <p>
    Ali
