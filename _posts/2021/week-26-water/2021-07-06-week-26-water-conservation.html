  <p>
    This week, we took a look at the <a href="importance-of-water-conservation.html" target="__blank">importance of water conservation</a> 
    and found out that the average American family uses <a href="https://www.epa.gov/watersense/how-we-use-water" target="__blank">
    300 gallons of water every day</a> at home. According to <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/07/140729093112.htm" target="__blank">
    Science Daily</a>, research shows that we will not have enough fresh water to meet demand by 2040, if 
    changes are not made beforehand. So, here are 20 ways to cut back on water usage, which will 
    not only conserve a critical resource, but save a ton of money in the process.

  <h2>Flush less</h2>
  <p>
    Every flush of a standard, older toilet uses 7 gallons of water. Instead of flushing every time 
    you go to the restroom, follow this little rhyme "If it's brown, flush it down. If it's yellow, keep it mellow."
