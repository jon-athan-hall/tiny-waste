    Big companies like Crest, Colgate, and Aquafresh are some of the world's leading suppliers of toothpaste. 
    This week's letter will ask them to phase out the plastic and stop testing their 
    products on animals. Please feel free to use this template to send your own request for sustainable changes.

    Good afternoon,
  </p>

  <p>
    My name is Alexandra and I've been using Aquafresh toothpaste for as long as I can remember. 
    I turned 34 this year, so I've gone through a decent amount of Aquafresh in my life. 
    This year, I resolved to produce less waste, which led me to notice that my used toothpaste 
    aren't curbside recyclable because of their mixed materials and always end up in the trash can.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm sure you've seen a rising concern over plastic waste. It takes hundreds of years to decompose 
    and often ends up as microplastics in our waterways. These microplastics are responsible for hundreds of 
    thousands of marine life deaths every year. I have seen recycling programs for dental products, but since the EPA 
    has reported that only 8% of plastics are actually recycled, this doesn't feel like a long term solution. 
    I would love to see you're toothpaste come in more sustainable packaging. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Another thing I realized recently is that Aquafresh tests their products on animals. More than 
    100 million animals suffer and die from testing in the US every year. Since there are multiple 
    cruelty-free toothpaste options on the market, I don't understand why this is necessary for 
    your company.
  </p>

  <p>
    In a world that grows more concerned with environmental and ethical concerns every day, 
    I'm certain that your patrons would love to see sustainable and ethical changes from Aquafresh. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank you so much for you time,
  </p>

  <p>
    Alexandra Hall
