    This week, I learned about the <a href="environmental-impact-of-coffee-and-tea.html" target="__blank">
    environmental impact of my caffeine habit</a> as well as <a href="low-waste-tea-and-coffee-options.html" target="__blank">
    ways to reduce my waste</a>. While my home brew routine is now waste-free, I know that there is 
    still plenty of plastic coffee and tea packaging that ends up in landfills. So, this week 
    I'm writing to coffee and tea brand, Keuring, and asking them to find a more 
    sustainable way to package their extremely popular single-serve pods.

  <p>
    Good afternoon,
  </p>

  <p>
   My name is Ali and my family and I have been Keurig fanatics for over a decade now. We love 
   the simplicity and ease with which we can make single-servings to suit our individual cravings. 
   I am always interested in the seasonal blends, while my husband prefers the most standard coffee flavor.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm writing because this year, I made a resolution to reduce the amount of waste I produce and realized 
    that your plastic pods are one of our biggest contributions. My husband and I have switched to the 
    reusable pods, but I know that the disposable plastic ones are still wildly popular.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I've seen that your pods are recyclable in some locations. However, that feels like a temporary solution, 
    since only 8% of plastics are actually recycled.  The rest end up in landfills, where they will take 
    hundreds of years to decompose, or in our waterways, where they break down into microplastics that 
    cause 100,000 marine animal deaths every year. Not to mention the manufacturing of plastic 
    uses oil and causes pollution.
  </p>

  <p>
    Iâ€™m aware that nothing can happen overnight, but at least working towards eliminating plastics 
    would be a huge step in the right direction. Perhaps you could look into compostable pods, so that 
    your consumers don't have to sacrifice convenience for sustainability.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It's no secret that plastics have become increasingly problematic and our earth is suffering 
    from the exorbitant amount of waste produced by humans. More and more people are becoming aware 
    of these issues and working towards a brighter, cleaner future for the next generation.
    I'm sure your consumers would be thrilled to see Keurig take such a strong approach to reducing 
    waste and protecting our planet. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Sincerely,
  </p>

  <p>
    Ali Hall
