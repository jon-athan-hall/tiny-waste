   A woman has, on average, about 450 periods in her lifetime, the average woman using about 
   <a href="https://zerowastememoirs.com/zero-waste-period/" target="__blank">9,600 tampons</a>. 
   This is both an enourmous amount of period waste sent to landfills, and a hefty amount of cash 
   spent on single-use items. Here are five sustainable alternatives to keep your trash can empty and 
   your bank account full.

  <h2>Menstrual Cups</h2>

  </a>
  <p>
    A menstrual cup is inserted similar to a tampon, but instead of absorbing, 
    it collects the blood until you take it out to empty and clean. Most cups can be left in around 10-12 hours, but 
    varies based on your individual cycle. Menstrual cups range from $10-$30 and can be used for up to 10 years or until 
    it shows visible signs of wear and tear.

    As with any hygiene product, you may have to do some expirementing to see which works best for you.

  <h2>Reusable cloth pads and panty liners </h2>

    {% include image-source-set.html image="12-feminine-hygiene/gladrags-pad.jpg" alt="green cloth pad" %}
  </a>
  <p>
    A cloth pad works exactly like a regular pad, except instead of sticking it to your underwear, you snap 
    or button it closed. And instead of throwing it in the trash after you use, you can wash and reuse it.

  <h2>Period underwear and clothes</h2>
  <a class="border:none" href="https://www.shethinx.com/collections/thinx-shop-all" target="__blank">
    {% include image-source-set.html image="12-feminine-hygiene/thinx-panties.jpg" alt="a black pair and grey pair of panties" %}
  </a>
  <p>
    Period underwear are worn like regular panties, but with the added benefit of absorbing one to four tampons 
    worth of menstruation. It may sound too good to be true, but I've heard many first hand accounts of success without having to use 
    any other feminine hygiene products. Period underwear ranges from $20-$50, but can be washed and worn 
    for years. Some companies even offer absorbant clothing options. Popular brands include <a href="https://www.shethinx.com/collections/thinx-shop-all" target="__blank">Thinx</a>, 
    <a href="https://periodaisle.com/products/hipster" target="__blank">Lunapads</a>, and <a href="https://knix.com/collections/period-underwear?loc=Main-ShopAllNav-LP&nav=PeriodUnderwear"

  <h2>Biodegradable tampons</h2>
  {% include image-source-set.html image="12-feminine-hygiene/natracare-tampons.jpg" alt="box of Natracare brand tampons " %}
  <p>
    If your desperate to stick with what you know, give biodegradable tampons a try. 
    They might still come with plastic wrapping, but there are a few options that are 100% cotton 
    and ditch the plastic applicator. Popular brands include <a href="https://www.ob-tampons.com/product-details/procomfortregular" target="__blank">
    o.b.</a> and <a href="https://www.natracare.com/" target="__blank">
    Natracare</a>.

  <h2>Reusable tampon applicator</h2>
  <a class="border:none" href="https://wearedame.co/products/reusable-applicator" target="__blank">
    {% include image-source-set.html image="12-feminine-hygiene/dame-applicator.jpg" alt="Dame brand reusable tampon applicator" %}
  </a>
  <p>
    If you've opted for biodegradable tampons, but miss the applicator, you can get a reusable one.
    A reusable applicator is simply a case that fits any size tampon to make insertion a little easier.
    Popular brands include <a href="https://wearedame.co/products/reusable-applicator" target="__blank">Dame</a> and 
    <a href="https://www.shethinx.com/products/thinx-reta-reusable-tampon-applicator" target="__blank">Thinx</a>.
