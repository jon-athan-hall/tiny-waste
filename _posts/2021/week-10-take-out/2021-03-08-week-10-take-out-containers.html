  <p>
    Not to be dramatic, but I would probably be dead if it weren't for take-out. When I lived in New York, 
    I had take away 4-5 times per week.<!--more--> As someone who had neither the willingness or experience to cook, I depended 
    on restaurants for many of my meals. To be fair, I usually left my apartment at 7:00 AM and returned home at 
    around 9:00 PM, but still, that's a lot of take-out. In fact, I probably ordered ordered take away 
    over 200 times in 2019 and most of those containers went to a landfill. In addition to landfill waste, I can look 
    back and see that that was some serious financial waste! Looking back, I could have brought sandwiches to 
    work every day and saved thousands of dollars.
  </p>
    
  <p>
    I was probably among the worst offenders when it came to collecting and trashing take-out containers, but now, I am both 
    aware of the problems and willing to make a change. I think it's unrealistic to ask everyone to completely cut it out of there lives. 
    It is, however, important to understand the effect take-out containers have on the environment and make a conscious 
    effort to cut down on the amount we send to a landfill.

  <h2>Why are take-out containers a problem?</h2>
  <p>
    As you know, the majority of take-out containers are plastic, which is made from fossil fuels and 
    takes hundreeds, if not thousands, of years to break down. Even the paper containers are lined with plastic, making 
    them impossible to recycle or biodegrade. 
   </p> 

   <p>
    In 2015, Americans placed <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2017/07/are-alternate-utensils-for-take-out-an-envrioment-friendly-option/" 
    target="__blank">2 billion</a> delivery orders. You might have guessed that the pandemic caused a massive increase in that number, 
    and you're correct. According to <a href="https://www.gobankingrates.com/saving-money/food/how-much-americans-spending-takeout-during-pandemic/#4"
    target="__blank">one survey</a>, 65% of Americans were ordering more take-out last year and from March 2020 
    to June 2020, they ordered an average of 2.4 times every week. 
  </p>

  <p>
    <a href="https://nypost.com/2017/12/08/americans-spend-an-absurd-amount-on-takeout/" target="__blank">
    Another survey</a> from 2017 estimates that the average American adult spends $1,175 on take-out 
    every year. Over sixty years, one person spends approximately $70,500. This isn't exactly an argument 
    for the environment, but I'm sure we can all think of a few things we would rather spend that money on.

  <h2>Are they recyclable?</h2>

  <p>
    Some, but not all, take-out containers are recyclable. 
  </p> 

  <ul>
    <li>
      One big misconception is that an item is recyclable if it has a recycling symbol on it. 
      However, the small number you see inside the recycling symbol on plastics only classifies 
      the type of plastic. It does not necessarily indicate recyclability and you'll have to 
      see which numbers are accepted by your curbside recycling. Usually #1 and #2 are ok, but make sure 
      to empty and rinse your containers so they don't contaminate other materials. 
    </li>

    <li>
      Styrofoam containers are rarely accepted in curbside recycling, since they are so lightweight and 
      typically hold onto food contaminates.
    </li>  

    <li>
      Paper bowls and chinese boxes go straight to the landfill, since they are lined with plastic and the 
      mixed materials are problematic for recycling facilities.
    </li>

    <li>
      Paper products like cardboard clamshells are compostable and recyclable if clean. 
    </li>
    
    <li>
      Pizza boxes cannot be recycled if they are covered in grease, but you can separate the clean sections 
      for recycling and compost the rest.
    </li>

    <li>
      Aluminum containers are recyclable, but must be cleaned first.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What if they are compostable?</h2>
  <p>
    There are lot of disposable products out there that claim to be compostable, but if you 
    look a little closer, you'll notice wording along the lines of "compostable in industrial facilities."
    This means they won't break down in your backyard compost or, for that matter, in a landfill. 
    These products should be avoided unless you have access to a commercial composting facility that accepts 
    them.

  <h2>How can I avoid take-out containers?</h2>
  <p>
   There are plenty of ways to avoid take-out containers, like meal planning so you're not scrambling
   to prepare a meal at the eleventh hour. Or, ordering a pizza so you'll get a biodegradable cardboard box 
   instead of plastic containers. For more tips, read my post <a href="how-to-avoid-take-out.html"

  <h2>Can I reuse take-out containers?</h2>
  <p>
    Yes! Plastic containers make excellent organizers for your home or office. You can save lidded 
    cups to clean up messy drawers or sort craft supplies. And if you have any #6 plastics, why not 
    make some <a href="make-shrinkie-dink-jewelry.html" target="__blank">Shrinkie Dink Jewelry.</a>
