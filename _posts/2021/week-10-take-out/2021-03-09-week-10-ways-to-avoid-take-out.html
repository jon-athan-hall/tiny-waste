    You don't have to completely give up ordering take-out to make a difference. Here are five habits 
    that can significantly reduce the amount of take away containers in your life.

  <h2>Start meal planning</h2>
  <p>
    Meal planning is probably the most effective way to avoid getting take-out. By planning 
    ahead, it's not as likely you'll have to rely on take away as a last minute fix. Meal planning 
    is also a great way to reduce food waste and financial waste.

  <h2>Pack a lunch</h2>
  <p>
    Packing a lunch doesn't have to be a huge ordeal. Make a sandwich or pack up some 
    leftovers to bring to work.

  <h2>Eat at the restaurant</h2>
  <p>
    As Covid restrictions lift, I'm sure we'll all be anxious to get back to dining at our 
    favorite restaurants. Eating there instead of ordering your meal to go is a great way to 
    cut down on those pesky plastic containers.

  <h2>Bring a container to restaurants</h2>
  <p>
    If you typically have leftovers to take home, bring a container to put them in. This way, 
    you won't have to use a to-go box from the restaurant.

  <h2>Set a limit</h2>
  <p>
    By simply setting a limit on the amount of take-out you allow yourself, you can cut down 
    on the amount of containers you go through. If you currently get take-out once a week, see if 
    you can handle once a month instead.
