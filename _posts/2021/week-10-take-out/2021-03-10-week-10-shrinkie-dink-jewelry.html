  <p>
    Sometimes take-out is a necessity, and while some containers are recyclable, not all are. 
    For instance salads often come in #6 plastics, but those aren't always accepted in curbside recycling.
    Instead of sending those #6 plastics to a landfill, you can make cute, on-of-a-kind jewelry!

    </li>
    <li>
      Scrap paper for making stencil

    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="10-take-out-containers/1-container.jpg" alt="clear plastic clamshell container" %}
      <p>
        Grab a clear #6 plastic container. I see them used most for salads and berries.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="10-take-out-containers/2-cut-flats.jpg" alt="scissors cutting into plastic clamshell" %}
      <p>
        Cut out the flat areas of your clamshell. I had one from the top and one from the bottom.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="10-take-out-containers/3-make-stencil.jpg" alt="leaf outline drawn on white paper" %}
      <p>
        Use a scrap piece of paper to draw a stencil that is the appropriate size for your 
        plastic pieces.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="10-take-out-containers/4-trace-image.jpg" alt="plastic piece over stencil with green marker drawn over black stench lines" %}
      <p>
        Trace the stencil onto your plastic piece.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="10-take-out-containers/5-color.jpg" alt="two sharpies and two plastic pieces with green jungle leaves drawn on them" %}
      <p>
        Use sharpies to color in your image. You can also use pencil colors, but you'll have to sand the plastic first.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="10-take-out-containers/6-cut-leaves.jpg" alt="pair of scissors and plastic cut out in the shape of jungle leaves" %}
      <p>
        Cut out the design you wish to shrink.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="10-take-out-containers/7-punch-hole.jpg" alt="close up of plastic leaf with hole punched in the top" %}
      <p>
        Use a hole punch (or scissors) to put a hole in the plastic, wherever you would like add the jewelry findings. 
        Make sure to put it no more that a quarter of an inch from the edge.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="10-take-out-containers/8-foil.jpg" alt="two plastic jungle leaves on a piece of plastic" %}
      <p>
        Preheat your oven to 325&#176;. Put your plastic on a piece of scrap foil, marker side up, and bake for 3 minutes.
        Let cool before handling.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="10-take-out-containers/9-final.jpg" alt="final product of shrinkie dink jungle leaf earrings" %}
      <p>
        Add jewelry findings to complete I made earrings, but you could make keychains, charm bracelets, 
        necklaces... anything you want!
