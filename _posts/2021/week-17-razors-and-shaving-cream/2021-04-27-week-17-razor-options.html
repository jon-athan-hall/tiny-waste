    Most of us use disposable razors for our shaving routine, which by definition, are not low waste. 
    In 1990, the <a href="https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPDF.cgi/2000URC7.PDF?Dockey=2000URC7.PDF" target="__blank">
    Environmental Protection Agency</a> reported that America produces 2 billion throwaway razors and blades 
    every year, but I'm certain that number has since gone up since. And the problem isn't solely coming from plastic 
    razors. Shaving cream, aftershave, and waxing strips all produce waste. Fortunately, there are low-waste replacements 
    for all of it!

  <h2>Safety razor</h2>
  {% include image-source-set.html image="17-razors/leaf-razor.jpg" alt="4 leaf brand safety razors in different colors" %}
  <p>
    You probably haven't seen a safety razor since your grandfather's day, but thanks to their 
    sustainability they are making a huge comeback. While there are many safety razors on the 
    market, <a href="https://leafshave.com/products/the-leaf-razor" target="__blank">The Leaf Razor</a> 
    is easily the most popular thanks to it's pivoting head and multi-blade system. At $85, it is 
    among some of the pricier options. However, it has a lifetime guarantee, so you should never 
    have to replace it. If you do have to dispose of your Leaf Razor for any reason, both the body 
    and the blades are 100% recyclable with metals, although you may have to find a spot that accepts scrap metal. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Not quite ready to spend big on a safety razor? <a href="https://packagefreeshop.com/collections/all/products/albatross-flagship-3-piece-razor" target="__blank">
    Package Free Shop</a> offers a more traditional model for $25. While this is still more expensive than 
    a disposable razor, remember that you'll save a significant amount of cash and plastic waste in the long run. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Whichever safety razor you end up with, you can collect the used blades and send them to <a href="https://albatrossdesigns.it/pages/albatross-blade-take-back-program" target="__blank">
    The Albatross Blade Take Back Program</a>. For details on how to participate, head to their website.
  </p>

  <p>
    The one drawback to safety razors is that they aren't allowed on planes. Normally I recommend using 
    what you have and only replacing it when necessary. However, in this case, it's best to save your 
    disposable razors for travel.

  <h2>Shaving soap</h2>
  {% include image-source-set.html image="17-razors/shaving-soap.jpg" alt="round bar of shaving soap" %}
  <p>
    Shaving cream containers may be recyclable, but because they are aerosols, they release chemicals that 
    contribute to global warming into the atmosphere. A more sustainable option is a shaving soap bar 
    like this one for $10 from <a href="https://packagefreeshop.com/collections/all/products/amber-ale-shave-body-bar" target="__blank">
    Package Free Shop</a>. You can also <a href="make-shaving-cream.html" target="__blank">make shaving cream</a> with 
    a few simple ingredients.

  <h2>Shaving brush</h2>
  {% include image-source-set.html image="17-razors/shaving-brush.jpg" alt="wooden handle shaving brush" %}
  <p>
    You obviously don't have to use a shaving brush, but if that's your method of choice, opt for a wooden handle with natural bristles.
    I like this $12 one from <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/758286500/natural-shaving-brush-zero-waste-100?ga_order=most_relevant&ga_search_type=all&ga_view_type=gallery&ga_search_query=compostable+shave+brush&ref=sr_gallery-1-1&organic_search_click=1">
    Brooklyn Made Natural</a> because it is made of 100% biodegradable materials.

  <h2>Aftershave</h2>
  {% include image-source-set.html image="17-razors/aftershave-tonic.jpg" alt="glass bottle of lovett sundries brand aftershave tonic" %}
  <p>
    Most grocery store aftershave options come in a plastic bottle with a laundry list of ingredients. 
    Instead, look for something in an infinitely recyclable glass bottle with ingredients you've heard of.
    <a href="https://packagefreeshop.com/products/aftershave-tonic?variant=39295560712289" target="__blank">
    Package Free Shop</a> offers a six ingredient, glass bottle aftershave tonic for $20 or you can use something 
    you already have at home like witch hazel or aloe vera.

  <h2>Sugar wax</h2>
  {% include image-source-set.html image="17-razors/sugar-wax.png" alt="wax made from sugar being used to remove hair from a leg" %}
  <p>
    If you prefer waxing for your unwanted hair removal, try waste free sugaring. 
    All you need is white sugar, lemon juice, and water to make the "wax", which spreads on your 
    problem areas and peels off without any plastic waste. For complete instructions, check out 
    this tutorial from <a href="https://gippslandunwrapped.com/2016/04/25/sugaring-the-waste-free-alternative-to-waxing/" target="__blank">
