    The day I had to start paying for my own shaving cream was the day I decided it was no longer a necessity.
    Even once I could afford to pay my rent and non-ramen groceries without working weekends, I still 
    opted for the ol' soap and hot water technique. This week, my solely monetary concerns were enhanced by
    environmental concerns. There are so many toxic ingredients in regular shaving cream that I'm slowly 
    trying to phase out of my life including parabens, sulfates, and pthalates.
  </p>

  <p>
    When I started searching for all natural alternatives, I found DIY recipes and suddenly, I felt like 
    I could get back in the shaving cream game! I tried out a few recipes that left my skin itchy, blotchy, or oily, 
    but after a few alterations, I found a combination that works for me. The castile soap did a great job 
    of cutting the oil and the baking soda was the magic ingredient that prevented razor burn.  
  </p>

  <p>
    This recipe takes about five minutes to make and lasts for two or three months. You really only need 
    about a quarter size dollop per leg. Feel free to play around with this recipe to find what works best 
    for your skin.
