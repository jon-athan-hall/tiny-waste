    There is no need to buy reusable bags when there are so many easy ways to make them from things 
    you probably already have lying around. In a few hours, I was able to whip up a whole fleet of 
    grocery totes!

    It took ten minutes to turn couple of t-shirts that my niece had grown out of into adorable little produce bags. 
    All it takes is a few cuts and a few knots. Obviously, bigger shirts would make bigger bags, but I like these for garlic and onions.

  <p>
    Pet food bags make excellent totes because they are sturdy and not usually recyclable. This easy <a href="https://www.allfreecrafts.com/paper/recycled/dog-bag-tote/" target="__blank">pattern</a>
    took all of fifteen minutes to clean and sew.

    This is a perfect <a href="https://happiestcamper.com/diy-foldable-reusable-grocery-bags/?epik=dj0yJnU9T2czVWFqRDlRSy1WQVV6dDR0XzJsdmR3M1RtVlIzaW4mcD0wJm49YjZxR1pkV3dtZDRFcnBodXhpVEc1USZ0PUFBQUFBR0FPRDNJ" target="__blank">
    pattern</a> for any scrap fabrics you have lying around. I used an old dish towel, but you 
    coud use practically anything! Torn or stained materials are a great go-to because they are unlikely to find a 
    second home from a donation center.

    I found this free <a href="https://www.weareknitters.com/free-patterns/edda-bag#utm_source=Pinterest&utm_medium=Social&utm_campaign=eddabag" target="__blank">pattern</a> from 
    We Are Knitters and I absolutley love how it turned out. You'll need 200g of yarn (one or two skeins) and it's all very basic crochet stitches.
    If you don't have any yarn on hand, you can always take apart a ratty sweater or thrift second hand yarn from a 
    place like Goodwill.
