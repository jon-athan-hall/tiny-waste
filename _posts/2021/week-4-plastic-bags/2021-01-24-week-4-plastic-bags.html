  <p>When Katy Perry asks if I ever feel like a plastic bag, I don't think of how they 
    casually drift through the wind, I think about how they litter the streets, 
    clog recycling machinery, and never really break down. <!--more-->

  <h2>The problem with plastic bags</h2>
  <p>
    According to the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/facts-and-figures-about-materials-waste-and-recycling/frequent-questions-regarding-epas-facts-and" target="__blank">EPA</a>, 
    4.2 million tons of plastic bags and films were generated in 2018 and 3.04 millions tons 
    ended up in a landfill. They, like all plastics, are made from crude oil, a non-renewable resource, which 
    is problematic for two reasons: manufacturing generates significant pollution and the product is not biodegradable. 
    As <a href="https://sciencing.com/why-are-plastic-bags-so-bad-for-the-environment-5005999.html" target="__blank">Sciencing.com</a>
    put it, "they are difficult to produce and nearly impossible to get rid of once produced".    
  </p>

  <p>
    Most plastic bags take a minimum of 400 hundred years to break down. If that fact doesn't get your blood boiling, 
    think of it this way...every plastic bag that's ever been sent to a landfill still exists. It gets worse. According 
    to <a href="http://natural-environment.com/blog/2008/01/10/environmental-impact-of-plastic-bags/" target="__blank">
    Natural-Environment.com</a>, plastic bags cause over 100,000 sea turtle and other marine animal deaths every year 
    when animals mistake them for food.

  <h2>So what do I use instead</h2>
  <p>
    The easiest way to reduce the amount of plastic bags floating around is to switch to reusable bags. 
    If you don't have a bag that works, consider making one out of some items you already have at home.
    Here are <a href="make-reusable-totes.html" target="__blank">five easy options</a> I made this week.

  <h2>What if I forget my bag</h2>
  <p>
    Remember last year, when it became mandatory to wear a mask in most stores? I forgot 
    mine a dozen times and it was <em>so frustrating</em>. I started keeping one in my purse, 
    one in the car, one by the front door and eventually, it became a part of my routine. Start 
    treating your reusable bag the same way you would your phone and wallet, as a necessity. 
    If you're already at a store and you've only purchased a few items, just refuse the bag and 
    carry them out in your hands.

  <h2>What should I do with bags I already have</h2>
  <p>
    One option is to repurpose them by making <a href="plastic-yarn.html" target="__blank">plarn</a> or plastic yarn! If you're not in a crafting mood,
    there are <a href="https://tiny-waste.com/chains-that-recycle.html" target="__blank">a few stores</a> 
    that recycle plastic bags and films. Unfortunately, while recycling is a step in 
    the right direction, it isn't a real solution...especially since <a href="https://ecologycenter.org/blog/trying-to-recycle-that-plastic-bag-the-odds-are-nine-to-one-its-not-happening/" target="__blank">
    studies</a> have shown that nine of ten times, it's not even happening. Instead, we should work 
    towards eliminating plastic bags altogether.

  <h2>But how could we possibly eliminate plastic bags</h2>
  <p>
    By writing letters, signing petitions, and educating each other! <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/environment-and-natural-resources/plastic-bag-legislation.aspx#:~:text=Eight%20states%E2%80%94California%2C%20Connecticut%2C,bags%20at%20large%20retail%20stores."
    target="__blank">8 states</a> and <a href="https://www.wri.org/blog/2019/03/127-countries-now-regulate-plastic-bags-why-arent-we-seeing-less-pollution#:~:text=Only%2055%20countries%20comprehensively%20restrict,to%20curb%20overall%20plastic%20pollution." target="__blank">55 countries</a> 
    have already banned plastic bags; it's no secret how harmful they are. Let your representatives 
    know that you would like to see a change. Request that your local grocery stop using plastic bags. 
    This is not a problem that can be fixed by one single person, but if we all show a desire to make 
    improvements, we are more likely to see them fulfilled. <a href="letter-template-plastic-bag-ban.html" target="__blank">Click here for letter templates.</a>
