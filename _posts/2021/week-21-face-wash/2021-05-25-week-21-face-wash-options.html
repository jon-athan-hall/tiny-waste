    For some of us, clear, vibrant skin requires soap made specifically for our faces. 
    Unfortunately, most face wash includes harmful ingredients and comes in plastic bottles. 
    However, there are sustainable alternatives, including face-specific bars, 
    infinitely recyclable glass bottles, and refillable aluminum bottles. Here are 
    ten low-waste options to consider when it's time to re-up on face wash.
