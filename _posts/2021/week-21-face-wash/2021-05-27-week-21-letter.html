  Good afternoon,
  </p>
  
  <p>
  My name is Ali and I started using Olay face wash a few years ago. This year, I’m making a conscious change to reduce my 
  carbon footprint and I’ve started to notice how much waste I’ve been contributing to our 
  earth. This includes waste from your plastic face wash bottles.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  I’m writing to see if you’ll consider making a more environmentally face option.  I know your plastic bottles can be recycled, 
  but that feels like a temporary solution since the EPA has reported that only 8% of plastics are 
  actually recycled. The rest end up in landfills, where they will take hundreds of years to break down, 
  or in our waterways, where they break down into microplastics that cause 100,000 marine animal deaths every year. In fact, 
  it’s estimated that by 2050, there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  I’m aware that nothing can happen overnight, but at least working towards phasing out plastics 
  would be a huge step in the right direction. Perhaps you could look into package free face wash bars,
  infinitely recyclable glass bottles, or refillable aluminum bottles.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  It's no secret that plastics have become increasingly problematic and our earth is suffering 
  from the exorbitant amount of waste produced by humans. More and more people are becoming aware 
  of these issues and working towards a brighter, cleaner future for the next generation, so 
  I'm certain your consumers would be thrilled to see Olay take a stand in protecting our 
  environment.
  </p>

  Thank you for your time,
  </p>
  
  <p>
