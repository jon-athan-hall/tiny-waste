    This week I took a good look at my beauty routine and its <a href="environmental-impact-of-makeup" target="__blank">
    environmental impact</a>. After taking a look at my makeup drawer, I realized just how much plastic
    waste I've produced over the last twenty years. As I use up the last of my conventional makeup, it's 
    time to find a low-waste, eco-friendly replacement. Here are ten sustainable brands I've found 
    that offer environmentally friendly packaging and natural ingredients.

  <h2>What's Next</h2>
  <p>
    Now that you've decided what to put on your face, why not make the way you take it off a little
    better for the environment. Instead of toxic makeup remover, use something more natural like 
    <a href="diy-skin-care-routine.html" target="__blank">olive oil</a>. And instead of 
    disposable cotton rounds, <a href="make-reusable-cotton-rounds.html" target="__blank">make resuable ones</a>
    with cotton fabric scraps.
