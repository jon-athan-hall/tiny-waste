    When I was a little girl, I would watch in admiration as my mom applied her makeup before work every morning  
    and I couldn't wait for my turn. While I never became a makeup fanatic, I've always wore the basics: 
    concealer, mascara, and some sort of lip balm. I couldn't begin to guess how many little 
    plastic makeup containers I've gone through in the last twenty years, but I'm sure all together, it 
    would make a pretty disturbing pile of garbage.  <!--more-->

  <h2>Why is makeup a problem for the environment?</h2>
  <p>
    According to <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/juliegerstein/heres-what-the-average-american-woman-spends-on-makeup-and" target="__blank">
    one poll</a>, the average woman spends $300,000 on makeup over the course of her lifetime. The majority of 
    makeup, even the nicest brands, comes in plastic containers as well as a lot of unecessary packaging.

  </p>

  <p>
    In addition, many products are made with <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/emily-lyons/makeup-pollution_b_10758282.html" target="__blank">
    synthetic materials</a> that can have a negative impact on the environment as well as our health.
    According to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), "The law does not require cosmetic products 
    and ingredients, other than color additives, to have FDA approval before they go on the market." 
    Titanium dioxide, parabens, pthalates, and triclosan are a few ingredients that have been linked to 
    health concerns and pose a problem when they are washed down the drain, thus ending up in our waterways. 
    Most cosmetics use small amounts of these ingredients and FDA official stance claims there is no reason 
    for consumers to worry, in my opinion, it's not worth the potential risk. 
  </p>
  
  <h3>Titanium dioxide</h3>
  <p>
    Titanium dioxide, often used in tinting agents and sunscreens, has been shown to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27060054/" target="__blank">
    inhibit the growth of phytoplankton</a>. According to a study shared by <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/12/151201094120.htm" target="__blank">
    Science Daily</a>, "about two-thirds of the planet's total atmospheric oxygen is produced by ocean phytoplankton -- 
    and therefore cessation would result in the depletion of atmospheric oxygen on a global scale. 
    This would likely result in the mass mortality of animals and humans." This ingredient is most harmful in nano particle form.
  </p>

  <h3>Parabens</h3>
  <p>
    Parabens, which are <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/should-people-be-concerned-about-parabens-in-beauty-products/" target="__blank">
    synthetic compounds used as preservatives</a>, have been linked to 
    <a href="https://www.prevention.com/beauty/a20507577/harmful-ingredients-in-body-lotion/" target="__blank">
    hormone disruption, reproductive issues, and breast cancer</a>. Most cosmetics use a such small amounts that 
    the FDA official stance claims there is no reason for consumers to worry, however, in my opinion, it's not 
    worth the potential risk. On top of that, <a href="https://www.ewg.org/what-are-parabens" target="__blank">studies have shown</a>
    that they can  be devastating to coral reefs.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here are the six most common parabens to look out for: methylparaben, ethylparaben, isobutylparaben, propylparaben, benzylparaben, butylparaben.
  </p>

  <h3>Pthalates</h3>
  <p>
    Pthalates are used as softeners in cosmetics, lubricating oils, childrens toys, and vinyl flooring. 
    The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/biomonitoring/Phthalates_FactSheet.html" target="__blank">CDC</a> has 
    found measurable amounts of pthalate metabolites in the general population. 
    Some pthalates have been proven to affect reproductivity in animals, while others have been 
    banned from children's due to their toxicity. However, since there is not enough research to conclude long 
    term affects in humans, many pthalates are merely on the EPA's "Chemicals of Concern" list. 
  </p>

  <h3>Triclosan</h3>
  <p>
    Triclosan is an anti-microbial agent often used in makeup powders, hand soaps, and body washes. 
    Studies have shown that it <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27067728/" target="__blank">negatively alters the 
    lifespan and fecundity</a> of freshwater organisms.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally, plastic packaging is problematic because it is made from non-renewable resources, has limited 
    recyclability, and takes hundreds if not thousands of years to break down. 
    Makeup containers, like all plastics, are made from crude oil, a non-renewable resource, which is harmful for two reasons: 
    manufacturing generates significant pollution and the product is not biodegradable. 
    As <a href="https://sciencing.com/why-are-plastic-bags-so-bad-for-the-environment-5005999.html" target="__blank">Sciencing.com</a>
    put it, "they are difficult to produce and nearly impossible to get rid of once produced". Instead of biodegrading, 
    plastic breaks down into tiny micro-plastics that litter our soil, our waterways, and even our air.

  <h2>What about makeup remover?</h2>
  <p>
    If you rely on face wash to remove your makeup, I covered its <a href="environmental-impact-of-face-wash.html" target="__blank">environmental impact</a> a few weeks ago. 
    I also offered a list of <a href="sustainable-face-soap-options.html" target="__blank">sustainable face soap options</a> and 
    shared a few recipes for a <a href="diy-skin-care-routine.html" target="__blank">DIY skin care routine</a>. However, 
    if you use speficic products like cotton rounds and makeup wipes, we have a few things to discuss. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Makeup wipes</strong> - I get it, their disposability makes makeup wipes very convenient, but at what cost?
    Most makeup up wipes are made of synthetic materials, which are simply put, another form of plastic. They 
    are used once and thrown away, where they will sit in a landfill for hundreds if not thousands of years.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Cotton rounds and balls</strong> - These might feel like an environmental upgrade, after all, cotton is biodegradable.
    However, many cotton rounds and cotton balls are made of a mix of cotton and synthetic materials. 
    Even when these products are made with 100% cotton, they aren't exactly ideal. First of all, they must be 
    composted to break down, since the lack of oxygen in a landfill will inhibit that process. Second, 
    cotton is a very thirsty plant that requires a lot of water. It can take <a href=" https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/the-impact-of-a-cotton-t-shirt" target="__blank">
    2,700 liters</a> to produce the cotton needed to make a single t-shirt. We'll cover water conservation in 
    a few weeks, but we definitely shouldn't be wasting any on single-use disposables like cotton rounds.
  </p>

    As an alternative, you can make your own <a href="make-reusable-cotton-rounds.html" target="__blank">
    reusable cotton rounds</a> out of cotton fabric remnants!

  <h2>Are makeup containers recyclable?</h2>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, the majority of makeup containers are not curbside recyclable. Their mixed materials 
    cannot be separated properly and their small sizes often clog up the machinery. 
    You should only toss products into the recycling bin if you are 100% sure they are accepted to avoid <a href="wishful-recycling.html" target="__blank">wishful recycling</a>.
    Remember that the small recycling symbol on a container <em>does not</em> mean it is recyclable, it only indicates the type of material being used. With that number, 
    you can check your local requirements to see if it is accepted with curbside pickup.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You can, however, send any beauty products to Terracycle for free via a recycling program in 
    partnership with <a href="https://www.terracycle.com/en-US/brigades/garnier#@40.77027075200147:-95.93705549677736zoom:4" target="__blank">Garnier</a>. 
    Or, you can drop your cosmetics off at a participating <a href="https://www.terracycle.com/en-US/brigades/nordstrom" target="__blank">Nordstrom</a> 
    for recycling.

  <h2>How can I be more sustainable?</h2>
  <p>
    You can start by using what you have instead of throwing barely used cosmetics in the trash. 
    When it's time to replace your makeup, try a brand that offers low-waste, recyclable, and/or compostable 
    packaging as well as environmentally friendly ingredients. Avoid parabens, pthalates, titanium dioxide, and 
    triclosan, which are all mentioned aboved as harmful materials often found in cosmetics.
