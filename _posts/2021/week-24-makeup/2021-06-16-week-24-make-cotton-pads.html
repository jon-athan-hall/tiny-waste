    This week was all about <a href="environmental-impact-of-makeup.html" target="__blank">
    the environmental impact of makeup</a>. I found <a href="sustainable-makeup-brands.html" target="__blank">
    10 Sustainable Makeup Brands</a> to try, but what about taking that makeup off?
  </p>
  <p>
    Cotton rounds are often used to aid in makeup removal, but they aren't always made of cotton.
    Even if they are, these single-use disposables are a waste of resources. Instead, you can 
    make reusable cotton makeup rounds from fabric remnants!
  </p>
  <p>
    This is a ridiculously easy project that is perfect for beginners. 
    Not feeling very crafty? You can also purchase a set of 20 cotton rounds from <a href="https://www.marleysmonsters.com/collections/facial-body-care/products/20-reusable-3-facial-rounds-shades-of-grey?variant=28485478789" target="__blank">
    Marley's Monsters</a> for $16.

  <h2>Let's make reusable cotton rounds!</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="24-makeup/1-gather-remnants.jpg" alt="various fabric scraps on a counter" %}
      <p>
        Gather your pre-washed cotton fabric scraps. I used remnants from a quilt project, but if you 
        prefer something softer, look for some old flannel. Goodwill and Facebook Marketplace are great 
        resources for inexpensive second-hand fabric.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="24-makeup/2-cut-doubles.jpg" alt="various fabric colors and shapes on a table" %}
      <p>
        Cut out two layers of various shapes. I know some people will prefer a uniform circle for each cotton 
        round, but I highly encourage you to use all of your scraps, regardless of shape. Double them up for 
        extra strength and absorbancy.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="24-makeup/3-sew-edges.jpg" alt="pile of fabric circles with serged edges" %}
      <p>
        Serge or zig-zag stitch around the edges and use as you would a normal cotton round. I rub
        a little olive oil as a <a href="diy-skin-care-routine.html" target="__blank">natural makeup remover</a> 
        and then use a cloth cotton round to wipe it away. When you've reached the end of your stash, put 
        them in a mesh wash bag and throw them into your next load of laundry.
      </p>
