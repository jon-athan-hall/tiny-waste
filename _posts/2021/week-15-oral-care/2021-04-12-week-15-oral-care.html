  <p>
    We've already switched to <a href="toothbrush.html" target="__blank">bamboo toothbrushes</a> and <a href="toothpaste.html" target="__blank">
    ethical, plastic-free toothpaste</a>, but there are still a few oral care items that need our attention. All oral care products contribute to our plastic waste problem. A few more dental products to consider replacing are teeth whitening strips, which are made using thin plastic sheets; disposable gum stimulators, also made of mixed plastic; and toothpicks, which are simply a waste of resources.

  <h2>Floss</h2>
  <p>
    If you floss once a day, you'll go through approximately <a href="https://www.deltadentalmi.com/getmedia/f8cb3de2-ac00-447c-94c3-f257ba271033/Delta-Dental-Tooth-Tips-Flyer-WEB.aspx" target="__blank">
    5 miles</a> of floss in your lifetime. Floss typically comes in a non-recyclable plastic container. 
    Most popular brands make their floss with nylon or polyester, which are both petroleum based products 
    that are not biodegradable. Other brands, like <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-01/ssi-dfa010819.php" target="__blank">
    Oral-B Glide</a> are made with the same compounds used in Teflon. At least <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-01/ssi-dfa010819.php" target="__blank">
    one study</a> has shown that this kind of floss can contribute to elevated levels of toxic PFA chemicals
    in the body. PFAs are water- and greas- proof substances that have been linked to have been linked with health effects including kidney and testicular cancer, thyroid disease, 
    high cholesterol, low birth weight, decreased fertility, and effects on the immune system.

  <h3>Should I reuse Floss?</h3>
  <p>
    That's a hard no. Bacteria, food remnants, and other residues are impossible to completely remove.

  <h2>Mouthwash</h2>
  <p>
    Unlike most of the products we've addressed this year, mouthwash bottles are actually curbside recyclable.
    However, since the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/facts-and-figures-about-materials-waste-and-recycling/plastics-material-specific-data" target="__blank">
    EPA</a> says only 8% of plastic gets recycled, it's best to avoid it where we can. 
  </p>
    
  <p>
    Beyond their containers, mouthwash. According to <a href="https://askthedentist.com/mouthwash-risks-and-alternatives/" target="__blank">
    askthedentist.com</a>, most mouthwash is made with a slew of harmful ingredients, including chlorine dioxide, 
    chlorhexidine, saccharin, and even formalhyde. These toxins are not only a problem for humans, but 
    after they've been spit down the drain, they go to our waterways and oceans, harming marine wildlife.
