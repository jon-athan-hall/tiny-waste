  <p>
    This week, while researching <a href="environmental-impact-of-lip-balm.html" target="__blank">the environmental impact of lip balm</a>,
    I learned that not only does lip balm come in plastic tubes, but it is often made of petroleum base, or 
    plastic, ingredients! That's way too much plastic for one tiny little tube, so I've found 12 
    all-natural, plastic-free alternatives to keep my lips moisturized. If none of these are speaking to 
    you, why not try <a href="diy-lip-balm.html" target="__blank">making your own lip balm</a> with this 
    simple recipe.

    lip-to-lid balmies aren't your average lip balm; they come in 14 colors and can be used as hydrating lip balm, 
    blush, and eye shadow. The best part is that they come in thin compostable paper wrap, making them the 
    lowest waste product on this list. These balmies are also vegan and cruelty-free. One balmie starts at $14 
    or you can opt for 3 balmies for $36 ($6 savings), or 14 for $96 ($100 savings).
