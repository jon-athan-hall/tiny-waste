    My poor little lips are chapped regardless of the season, so applying lip balm is a pretty 
    consistent part of my day. I've never kept track of how much lip balm I go through, but honestly, 
    the tubes are so small that I lose them often (and so inexpensive that I don't mind replacing 
    them on a regular basis). This week, I'm saying goodbye to the trail of tiny plastic lip balm tubes 
    I've been leaving in my wake and searching for a sustainable alternative.<!--more-->

  <h2>Why is lip balm a problem?</h2>
  <p>
    Conventional lip balm not only comes in plastic, but is made using forms of plastic. 
    Most lip balms contain <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/4-harmful-ingredients-want-avoid-140000846.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZWNvc2lhLm9yZy8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKhv8dm9rBJD2Tl6T3HzumITPA4RMgjAhrxWLP55INsEbK8kzLyRgG99ly13QkPmbJ2O5FDxgH2rEavGVohVbPYDepVoz2tXQqhn03dPRYAuDNuYmUoGwMUic0o_0-NY6KKDSoQ8InDruklvnANK2xaszQoKqAvhiXVYILUxiSrO" target="__blank">
    synthetic waxes and petroleum-derived ingredients</a> like paraffin or mineral oil. 
    That means that while wearing lip balm, every time we lick our lips or take a sip of water, we 
    are swallowing plastic. In the words of Randy Jackson, "that's gonna be a no from me, dawg."
  </p>

  <p>
    Plastics are problematic because they are made from non-renewable resources, have limited 
    recyclability, and take hundreds if not thousands of years to break down. 
    Lip balm tubes, like all plastics, are made from crude oil, a non-renewable resource, which is harmful for two reasons: 
    manufacturing generates significant pollution and the product is not biodegradable. 
    As <a href="https://sciencing.com/why-are-plastic-bags-so-bad-for-the-environment-5005999.html" target="__blank">Sciencing.com</a>
    put it, "they are difficult to produce and nearly impossible to get rid of once produced". Instead of biodegrading, 
    plastic breaks down into tiny micro-plastics that litter our soil, our waterways, and even our air.

  <h2>Can plastic lip balm tubes be recycled?</h2>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, lip balm tubes are not curbside recyclable because they are small enough to 
    clog up the machinery and are typically made of a mix of plastics. However, you can print 
    out a free shipping label and send them to <a href="https://www.terracycle.com/en-US/brigades/garnier#@40.77027075200147:-95.93705549677736zoom:4" target="__blank">
    Terracycle</a> via a program sponsored by Garnier. Or, you can drop them off for recycling 
    at participating <a href="https://www.terracycle.com/en-US/brigades/nordstrom#@40.77027075200147:-95.93705549677736zoom:4" target="__blank">
    Nordstrom stores</a>.

  <h2>How can I be more sustainable?</h2>
  <p>
    Opt for lip balm with all natural ingredients in low waste containers like cardboard, 
    glass, or aluminum. Read my next post for <a href="10-sustainable-lip-balm-options.html" target="__blank">

    You can also consider upcycling your empty lib balm tubes! They make excellent travel containers for bobby pins, matches, pills, and even <a href="toothpaste-options.html" target="__blank">
    toothpaste tablets</a>. Or, you can refill old tubes with a this <a href="diy-lip-balm.html" target="__blank">
