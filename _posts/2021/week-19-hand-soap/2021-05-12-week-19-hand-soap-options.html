  <h2>Ethique Hand Soap Concentrate</h2>
  {% include image-source-set.html image="19-hand-soap/ethique-hand-soap.jpg" alt="bar and box of ethique brand hand soap concentrate with lemon wedge" %}
  <p>
    <a href="https://ethique.com/collections/handwash-concentrates"  target="__blank">Ethique</a> recognize that 
    sharing a bar of soap to wash your hands is not ideal for many people. So, they came up with a soap concentrate 
    that you simply mix with boiling water to make a foamy liquid hand soap. You can buy 
    one bar for $8.50 on their website. A plastic free box of soap concentrate from Ethique will make one 
    12oz bottle of cruelty-free hand soap.

  <p>
    There are a lot of bar soap options on the market, but I love 
    Dr. Bronner's because it is all natural, cruelty-free, organic, and biodegradable. The soap 
    bars come in 10 scent options and a 100% post-consumer recycled wrapper. Dr. Bronner's can be found 
    at many chain and grocery stores including Target and REI, or on you can buy directly from 
    <a href="https://www.target.com/p/dr-bronner-s-bar-soap-lavender-5oz/-/A-11007066#lnk=sametab" target="__blank">
