<section class="letter">
  <p>
  Good afternoon,
  </p>
  
  <p>
    My name is Ali and I’ve been using Mrs. Meyer's products since I moved to New York City over a decade ago. 
    It became my soap of choice when I saw that you are cruelty-free and use plant-derived ingredients. I 
    also love the scents you offer. 
  </p>
  <p>
    This year, I’m making a conscious effort to reduce my carbon footprint and I’ve started to 
    notice how much waste I’ve been contributing to our earth. This includes waste from your 
    plastic hand soap bottles.  
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I’m writing to see if you’ll consider making a more environmentally friendly hand soap option.  I applaud 
    that you use 25% of post-consumer plastic in your bottles and I know that they are recyclable.
    But that feels like a temporary solution since the EPA has reported that only 8% of plastics are 
    actually recycled. The rest end up in landfills, where they will take hundreds of years to break down, 
    or in our waterways, where they break down into microplastics that cause 100,000 marine animal deaths every year. In fact, 
    it’s estimated that by 2050, there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I’m aware that nothing can happen overnight, but at least working towards phasing out plastics 
    would be a huge step in the right direction. Perhaps you could look into a package free soap bar 
    or infinitely recyclable glass and aluminum bottles. There are other companies, like Plaine Products, 
    that even take back their aluminum bottles for a completely circular business model.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It's no secret that plastics have become increasingly problematic and our earth is suffering 
    from the exorbitant amount of waste produced by humans. More and more people are becoming aware 
    of these issues and working towards a brighter, cleaner future for the next generation, so 
    I'm certain your consumers would be thrilled to see Mrs. Meyers take a stand in protecting our 
    environment.

  <p>
  Thank you for your time,
  </p>
  
  <p>
