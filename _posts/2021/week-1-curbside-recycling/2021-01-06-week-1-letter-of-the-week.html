  <p>
    When I started my Tiny Waste Resolution and commited to writing a letter every week, I completely dismissed
    the fact I hate writing letters. Even worse, that I try to avoid confrontation at all costs...
    even if it is virtual confrontation. However, conserving the planet is more important that avoiding mild discomfort, 
    so here we go!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    To ease into the process, my first "Letter of the Week" is simply asking about whether or not a company's packaging
    is recyclable. My goal was to be concise while getting three main points across:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>I like their product and have been a consumer for a long time</li>
    <li>Sustainability is important to me</li>
    <li>I will share this information, good or bad, with my peers.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Please feel free to use this template and write your own letter!</p>

    Greetings!
  </p>

  <p>
    My name is Alexandra Hall and I have been enjoying Hillshire Farms products for decades. My husband 
    and I add the Smoked Beef Sausage into all of our favorite southern recipes and your L’il Smokies 
    are a breakfast favorite.
  </p>

  <p>
    This year, I am trying to reduce the amount of waste I send to landfills and my first step is to 
    start recycling. Since I do not see any information on the packaging, I’m writing to find out if 
    your sausage wrappers can be recycled or if Hillshire Farms has plans to make recyclable packaging 
    in the near future. 
  </p>

  <p>
    If there are any other sustainable efforts your company is making, please let me know so I can 
    spread the word to my fellow eco-conscious friends and family.
  </p>  

  <p>
    Thank you,<br>
    Ali Hall
