  <p>
    It doesn't take much to make your own hankie and by keeping one on you, you'll have no need 
    to waste a paper napkin when you're out and about. Note: this tutorial is only for the napkin itself, 
    not a lesson on embroidery.

  <h2>Let's make a hankie!</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="8-paper-napkins/1-pillowcase.jpg" alt="white linen pillowcase folded on table" %}
      <p>
        Grab your fabric. I used a stained linen pillowcase that my sister was getting rid of.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="8-paper-napkins/2-cut-square.jpg" alt="cut square of linen fabric" %}
      <p>
        Cut out a square. You can make it any size you like, but I cut out 12" x 12" and found it 
        to be perfect.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="8-paper-napkins/3-diagonal-square.jpg" alt="linen fabric folded on the diagonal" %}
      <p>
        You can fold your square diagonally to make sure it is a nice even square.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="8-paper-napkins/4-iron.jpg" alt="iron setting fold of linen fabric" %}
      <p>
        Fold over each edge about a quarter of an inch and iron.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="8-paper-napkins/5-trim-corner.jpg" alt="small part of fabric corner snipped off at a 15 degree angle" %}
      <p>
        Snip off a small triangle from each corner. See picture.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="8-paper-napkins/6-fold-corner.jpg" alt="fabric folded down at corners" %}
      <p>
        Fold down each corner about a quarter of an inch from point.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="8-paper-napkins/7-fold-and-pin.jpg" alt="fabric edges folded a second time and pinned making clean 45 degree seam at corners " %}
      <p>
        Fold each edge over a quarter of an inch and pin in place. Corners should meet at a clean 45 degree seam.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="8-paper-napkins/8-fold-and-iron.jpg" alt="iron on folded edges of fabric" %}
      <p>
        Iron your new folds to set the crease.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="8-paper-napkins/9-sew.jpg" alt="close up of sewing maching working down edge of fabric" %}
      <p>
        Sew down all four sides by hand or machine. You should be able to use the edge of the sewing machine foot 
        as a guide. 
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="8-paper-napkins/10-final.jpg" alt="finished napking with embroider letter A" %}
      <p>
        Your hankie is complete. Embellish however you like! I embroidered a little floral "A" for my first name.
