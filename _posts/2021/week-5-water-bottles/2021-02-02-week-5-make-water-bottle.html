  <p>
    Why buy a reusable water bottle when you can make one from a glass jar or bottle you already have? 
    In this tutorial, I'll teach you how to upcycle any glass jar or bottle by removing the label and the odor. 
    You can stop right there or continue learning how to personalize it with a little etching.

  <h2>What you'll need</h2>
  <h3>To remove label and odor</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Glass Bottle - I like vinegar bottles because they have a screw on cap and nice shape.</li>
    <li>Pot that is big enough to fit bottle</li>
    <li>Baking Soda</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>To etch</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Cricut Vinyl Scraps, Sticker Negatives, or Masking/Painters Tape. I think this is a great 
      opportunity to use the backs of sticker sheets and Cricut scraps that would normally be trash.
    </li>
    <li>
      Etching Cream - ideally from a local art supply store and not a big chain. I use Armour Etch, 
      which does come in a plastic bottle, but a little bit goes a long way so you can do many projects 
      with one small bottle.
    </li>
    <li>Paint Brush</li>
    <li>Rag to wipe away etching cream</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Let's make a water bottle!</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="5-water-bottles/1-mtc-bottle.jpg" alt="glass vinegar bottle on counter" %}
      <p>
        Grab a glass bottle. I like this vinegar bottle because is has a screw on cap and 
        similar shape to plastic water bottles.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="5-water-bottles/2-mtc-baking-soda.jpg" alt="instant pot full of water with baking soda being sprinkled in" %}
      <p>
        First, we'll remove the label. Get a large pot of water simmering and pour in a 
        little baking soda.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="5-water-bottles/3-mtc-hot-water.jpg" alt="vinegar bottle in hot pot of water" %}
      <p>
        Put your glass bottle in the pot of hot water, fully submerging the label. You may  
        need to add a little water to the bottle to weigh it down. Within a few minutes, the label 
        will fall off. Pull the bottle out and dry it off. 
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="5-water-bottles/4-mtc-deodorize.jpg" alt="glass bottle with a little bit of water and baking soda" %}
      <p>
        Now, let's take care of any remaining odors. Add water and a spoonful of baking soda 
        to your bottle and shake, shake, shake it for about a minute. If your bottle still stinks, repeat 
        this step and shake a little longer.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="5-water-bottles/5-mtc-stickers.jpg" alt="cricut scraps, sticker page and painters tape on a table" %}
      <p>
        Find Cricut scraps or unused sticker sheets that can make a design on your bottle. Painters and 
        masking tape will also work for clean edges.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="5-water-bottles/6-place-stickers.jpg" alt="polka dot sticky sheet being placed on bottle" %}
      <p>
        Make sure your bottle is dry and place your stickers or tape on the bottle. Note that 
        the exposed area will be the design left behind. Push down all sticker edges to keep etching cream from 
        creeping beyond the desired area.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="5-water-bottles/7-mtc-apply-cream.jpg" alt="armour etch cream being applied to exposed dots on glass bottle" %}
      <p>
        Apply etching cream to all of the areas you would like to see etched. <em>Do not get this on your skin or in your eyes,</em> 
        as it can badly irritate or even burn them. Use gloves and goggles to protect yourself.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="5-water-bottles/8-mtc-cover-dots.jpg" alt="etching cream applied to all polka dots on bottle" %}
      <p>
        Once all desired areas have received the etching cream. Let set for five minutes. Any less and it may not 
        etch completely. Any more and the stencil may begin to wear out. 
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="5-water-bottles/9-mtc-rinse.jpg" alt="glass bottle being rinsed off under faucet" %}
      <p>
        After 5 minutes, rinse the etching cream off of the bottle.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="5-water-bottles/10-mtc-wipe.jpg" alt="hand using rag to wipe off remaining etching cream" %}
      <p>
        Use an old wet rag to wipe away any remaining etching cream.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="5-water-bottles/11-mtc-remove-sticker.jpg" alt="polka dot stick being pulled off of bottle" %}
      <p>
        Remove the stickers and tape from your bottle.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="5-water-bottles/12-mtc-finished.jpg" alt="finished product glass bottle with etched polka dots" %}
