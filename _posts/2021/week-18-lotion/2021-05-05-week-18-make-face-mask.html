    Sheet masks are my ultimate pampering item. My sister and I even have girls' nights  
    that revolve around those goopy little masks. <a href="environmental-impact-of-lotion.html" target="__blank">This week</a> 
    I was horrified to discover that my beloved sheet masks are not only packaged in plastic, but the 
    masks themselves are usually made up plastic. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Even though sheet masks are typically only a few dollars a pop and rarely bigger than a napkin, 
    the amount of monetary and landfill-bound waste really adds up. So instead, I've made my 
    own reusable one! I've even shared a free pattern below so you can make your own.

    </li>

    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="18-lotion/4-sew-edges.jpg" alt="sewing machine doing zig zag stitch around oval edges" %}
      <p>
        Use a serger or zigzag stitch to sew the outer edge and keep fabric from fraying.

      {% include image-source-set.html image="18-lotion/5-sew-holes.jpg" alt="zig zag stitch sewn around pattern marks" %}
      <p>
        Now, serge or zig zag the eyes, mouth, nose, and side slits.

    </li>

    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="18-lotion/6-cut-holes.jpg" alt="two eye holes, a mouth hole, and a nose slit cut out of oval fabric" %}

        Once the edges are all sewn, you can make the rest of your cuts. Your sheet mask is ready to use! Try one of the serums above or make your 
        own mixture.
