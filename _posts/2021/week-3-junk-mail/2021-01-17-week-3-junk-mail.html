  <p>
    Just about every time I check the mail, I notice that it is almost entirely made up of
    coupons, catalogues and credit card offers that I never asked for and I never open.<!--more--> I have a 
    pretty good feeling I'm not the only one with a surplus of unwanted mail, since the 
    <a href="https://facts.usps.com/table-facts/" target="__blank">USPS</a> reported delivering
    75.7 billion units of marketing mail in 2019, but <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/home/
    how-to-stop-junk-mail-and-save-trees--and-your-sanity/2018/02/12/6000e4c4-05d9-11e8-b48c-b07fea957bd5_story.html" 
    target="__blank">44% of that went unopened</a> . I'm starting to understand why it's called "junk mail".
  </p>

  <p>
    Ready for the worst part? It's estimated that it takes about <a href="https://healtheplanet.com/100-ways-to-heal-the-planet/junk-mail/" target="__blank">
    100 million trees</a> to generate a year's worth of that unwanted mail. This is especially problematic since 
    <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/deforestation-and-global-warming/" target="__blank">deforestation</a> 
    accounts for 15% of global carbon emissions.
  </p>

  <p>
    At this point, I'm sure you're itching to get your name off those mailing lists, and since it only takes a 
    few minutes, why not start saving those trees right now!

  <h2>Pre Screened Credit Card Offers</h2>
  <p>
    To take your name off of this list, head to <a href="https://www.optoutprescreen.com/selection" target="__blank">OptOutPrescreen</a> 
    This is a free service that takes about one minute to complete. You can choose between a 5-year or permanent opt-out. 
    If you choose the latter, you'll be required to print out, sign and mail the Permanent Opt-Out Election form. 
    To reach OptOutPrescreen by phone, call <a href="tel:18885678688">1-888-567-8688</a> (thatâ€™s 888-5OPT-OUT).

  <h2>Catalogues</h2>
  <p>
    Grab a stack of catalogues that you no longer want to receive and go to <a href="https://www.catalogchoice.org/" target="__blank" >CatalogChoice</a>
    to opt out of each one individually. Yes, you have to go one by one, but it is free and will probably take less than
    five minutes.

  <h2>Direct Marketing</h2>
  <p>
    Basically, there are a whole slew of <a href="https://www.ana.net/members/list" target="__blank">brands and companies</a> that use the Association of National Advertising 
    to send out their promotions and ads. This includes credit card offers, catalogs, magazine offers, donation requests, retail promotions, bank offers, and many others. 
    <a href="https://www.dmachoice.org/" target="__blank">DMAchoice.org</a> is a tool offered by the Data & Marketing
    Association that allows you to opt out of these mailing lists. It does cost $2, but it only takes a few minutes and
    your name will be off these lists for ten years.

  <h2 class="highlight">Phone Books</h2>
  <p>
    I can't remember the last time I used a phone book, so it was easy for me to say goodbye.
    A quick visit to <a href="https://www.yellowpagesoptout.com/user/register?zipcode=19085" target="__blank">Yellow pages</a>
    had me off the list in less than a minute.

  <h2>Valpak Coupons</h2>
  <p>
    Valpak is mailed to 45 million households in North America each month. I don't know about you, 
    but I have never even opened a Valpak envelope. Take your address off the mailing list 
    <a href="https://www.valpak.com/coupons/show/mailinglistsuppression" target="__blank">here</a>.

  <h2>Bills</h2>
  <p>
    Ok, I know bills aren't exactly "junk", but they are definitely a waste of paper. If you haven't 
    already made the switch to paperless billing, this is the perfect opportunity to do so. These days, most of your
    major bills include instructions on how to opt-out of printed copies. And don't worry, if the need arises,
    you can always print a copy from your account online.

  <h2>Previous Resident</h2>
  <p>
    This isn't a problem for everyone, but as someone who moves every few years, I am constantly receiving
    mail for people who are no longer residents. You can collect all that mail and put it back in your 
    mailbox with a note that says "No longer at this address". A postal worker will take that mail and make the 
    necessary changes the next time he/she delivers to your addresss.

  <h2>Charities</h2>
  <p>Yes, I saved the hardest for last. Asking a charity to stop sending you mail can feel a little gross, but 
    does it feel worse than global warming? Not likely. Unfortunately, there is no centralized opt-out system for charity mailings. 
    Instead, when you make a donation, include a note with it requesting that the charity not rent, sell or trade your name  
    (you can make this same request of businesses). You can also request that your chosen charities only solicit 
    you once a year. If you're not sure exactly sure what to say, take a look at my <a href="letter-template-mailing-list-removal.html" target="__blank">Letter of the Week</a> for a template.
