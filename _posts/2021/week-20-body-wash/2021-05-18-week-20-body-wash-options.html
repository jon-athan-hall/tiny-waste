    Most body wash comes in a plastic bottle, but there are plenty of low-waste alternatives. 
    We can choose between package free soap bars, infinitely recyclable glass bottles, and 
    even refillable aluminum bottles. Here are ten sustainable options that will 
    help you find a sustainable shower routine.

    There are a lot of bar soap options on the market, but I love

    at many chain and grocery stores including Target and REI, or you can buy directly from 
    <a href="https://shop.drbronner.com/collections/soaps/products/peppermint-pure-castile-bar-soap" target="__blank">their website</a>. One 5 oz bar costs $4.79.
