    According to <a href="https://www.reduce-plastic-waste.com/" target="__blank">Reduce Plastic Waste</a>
    238 million Americans use body wash in disposable bottles. That means an estimated 1.4 billion disposable 
    bottles are used every year. This week's letter asks popular body wash brand, Suave, to phase out plastics and offer more sustainable 
    body wash options. Use this template to write to your favorite body wash brand.

  Good afternoon,
  </p>
  
  <p>
  My name is Ali and Suave is the prominent body wash in my house. We've always liked the 
  array of scents suitable for all genders.  This year, I’m making a conscious change to reduce my 
  carbon footprint and I’ve started to notice how much waste I’ve been contributing to our 
  Earth. This includes waste from your plastic body wash bottles.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  I’m writing to see if you’ll consider making a more environmentally friendly body wash option.  I know your 
  plastic bottles can be recycled, but that feels like a temporary solution since the EPA has 
  reported that only 8% of plastics are actually recycled. The rest end up in landfills, where 
  they will take hundreds of years to break down, or in our waterways, where they break down 
  into microplastics that cause 100,000 marine animal deaths every year. In fact, it’s estimated that 
  by 2050, there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  I’m aware that nothing can happen overnight, but at least working towards phasing out plastics 
  would be a huge step in the right direction. Perhaps you could look into a package free soap bars,
  infinitely recyclable glass bottlese, or even refillable aluminum bottles.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  It's no secret that plastics have become increasingly problematic and our earth is suffering 
  from the exorbitant amount of waste produced by humans. More and more people are becoming aware 
  of these issues and working towards a brighter, cleaner future for the next generation. 
  I'm certain your consumers would be thrilled to see Suave take a stand in protecting our 
  environment.
  </p>

  Thank you for your time,
  </p>
  
  <p>
  Ali Hall
