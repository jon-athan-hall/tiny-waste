    This week I opted for a quick, but functional craft project - making specialty recycling bins for some of the 
    items that aren't accepted in my curbside pickup. You can use <em>any</em> containers, but might I suggest choosing
    some that can't be recycled and will end its life in a landfill. Think Pringles, Folgers, Panko Bread Crumbs...the ones 
    made up of multiple materials.

      {% include image-source-set.html image="2-specialty-recycling/MTC2-can.jpg" alt="bread crumb container" %}
      <p>
        Pick out a plastic or landfill-bound container. We jut happened to have multiple bread crumbs, 
        but you could use large yogurt cups, peanut butter jars...basically anything.

    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="2-specialty-recycling/MTC2-remove-wrapper.jpg" alt="bread crumb container with label removed" %}
      <p>
        Remove the label.
      </p>
    </li>

      {% include image-source-set.html image="2-specialty-recycling/MTC2-cut-hole.jpg" alt="plastic lid with hole cut in the middle" %}
      <p>
        With scissors, cut a hole in the lid. Make sure it is big enough to fit your intended recyclables.
      </p>

      {% include image-source-set.html image="2-specialty-recycling/MTC2-paint.jpg" alt="blue plastic lid being spraypainted black" %}
      <p>
        Use acrylic paint or plastic-friendly spray paint to color the lids. This step is completely optional. 
        I had black spray paint in my craft supplies, so I gave my lids a quick coat.

      {% include image-source-set.html image="2-specialty-recycling/MTC2-label.jpg" alt="silver container with black sharpie writing" %}
      <p>
        Label your containers with a sharpie. You could have one for plastic bags, batteries, corks...
      </p>
    </li>

        Well, that took about five minutes and now my dead batteries have a home.
