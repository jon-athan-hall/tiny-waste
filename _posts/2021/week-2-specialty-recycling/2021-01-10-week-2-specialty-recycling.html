  <p>
    Now that I've gotten a handle on what can go into my curbside recycling bins, it's time to find a way to 
    recycle everything else. Here are a few things that come up fairly frequently in my house.

  <h2>Plastic bags</h2>
  <p>
    Last week I learned that plastic bags and films should never go into my curbside recycling bins since they 
    clog up the machinery. This week I learned that <a href="https://help.target.com/help/TargetGuestHelpArticleDetail?articleId=ka91Y000000g4OpQ
    AI&articleTitle=Can+I+recycle+items+at+a+Target+store%3F" target="_blank">Target</a> and 
    <a href="https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/tips-and-ideas/archive/tricky-recycling-made-easy" target="_blank">Whole Foods Market</a>
    have bins at every location for thin plastic recycling.

  <h2>Electronic waste</h2> 
  <p>Only 10% of global e-waste gets recycled, while the rest of it ends up getting 
    landfilled or incinerated. E-waste is made of all sorts of harmful chemicals, so if it is mishandled during 
    disposal, these chemicals end up in our soil, water, and air. <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/services/
    recycling/pcmcat149900050025.c?id=pcmcat149900050025" target="_blank">Best Buy</a> and 
    <a href="https://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/noheader/sustainability-center/recycling-services/?icid=SustainabilityCenter:topnav:3:recycling:20170901" target="_blank">
    Staples</a> both take an assortment of electronic waste for recycling.

  <h2>Clothing and shoes</h2> 
  <p>
    According to the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/facts-and-figures-about-materials-waste-and-recycling/nondurable-goods-product-specific-data#ClothingandFootwear" target="_blank">
    EPA</a>, textiles make up nearly 8% of landfill waste. In 2018, The U.S. sent 9,070,000 tons of clothing and 
    shoes to landfills. Add towels, sheets, and pillowcases and we're at 11,000,000 tons of textile waste.

    all have some form of an apparel recycling program.
  </p>

  <p>
    Old kicks can be donated to an organization like <a href="https://soles4souls.org/" target="_blank">Soles4Souls</a>, which gives gently used shoes 
    to people in poverty. Or, sneakers can be dropped off at any <a href="https://www.nike.com/help/a/recycle-shoes" target="_blank">Nike</a> 
    location, where they will be recycled into new material.

  <h2>Beauty products</h2>
  <p>
    The beauty industry creates 120 billion units of packaging every year. Hair care, makeup, and skin care tubes and containers can be dropped off in any 
    <a href="https://www.nordstrom.com/browse/nordstrom-cares/get-involved/nordstrom-beauty-cycle" target="_blank">Nordstrom</a>.
    You can also get a free shipping label and send them to a recycling program sponsored by

  <h2>Batteries</h2>

    Household batteries can be brought to <a href="https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/tips-and-ideas/archive/tricky-recycling-made-easy" target="_blank">Whole Foods</a>

  <h2>Lightbulbs</h2>
  <p>
    Since they contain mercury, fluorescent bulbs should be recycled in order to ensure that they stay 
    out of landfills where they could contaminate the air, soil and/or groundwater. 
    CFL (Compact Flourescent Lightbulbs) can be dropped off at 
    <a href="https://corporate.lowes.com/newsroom/stories/fresh-thinking/3-easy-ways-help-recycle-rechargeable-batteries">Lowe's</a> and
    <a href="https://corporate.homedepot.com/newsroom/second-life-hard-recycle-items" target="_blank">Home Depot</a>.

  <h2>Automotive oil</h2>
  <p>
    Motor oil that isnâ€™t disposed of properly releases about 25 times more oil into the environment 
    than what spills from all modes of oil transportation combined. Used automotive oil can be recycled at <a href="https://shop.advanceautoparts.com/r/advice/cars-101/

  <h2>Everything else</h2> 
  <p>
    It's not a free service, but just about anything else you can think of can be recycled through 
    <a href="https://www.terracycle.com/en-US/" target="_blank">Terracycle</a>. 
    Simply order a box, fill it up and send it back.
