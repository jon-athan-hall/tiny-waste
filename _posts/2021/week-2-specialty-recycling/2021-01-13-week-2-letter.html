    I never thought recycling was going to solve all of my waste problems, but I definitely didn't realize 
    how many products that I love and use on a regular basis cannot be recycled. This week, I'm writing to ask
    a company to consider making recyclable materials and packaging.

    Greetings!
  </p>

  <p>
    My name is Ali Hall and I am obsessed with my Cricut! I get excited every time I start a new project 
    and my Explore has brought me so much crafting joy. 
  </p>

  <p>
    My first Cricut project of the year was to make some adorable vinyl labels for my recycling bins because
    this year, I am trying to reduce my waste. After I finished the project, I realized how many
    pieces of scraps and packaging aren't accepted in my curbside recycling bins and will eventually end
    up in a landfill. So, I'm writing to see if Cricut has any plans on making more sustainable packaging 
    and materials. I understand that nothing can change overnight, but in the mean time, I've seen a few 
    companies with tricky recyclability that have teamed up with Terracycle so that their products can be given a 
    second life.
  </p>

  <p>
    I do hope you'll consider this request from a loyal, but eco-concious consumer. Please let me know if 
    Cricut is working towards any sort of sustainibily so I can share the information with my
    equally concerned Cricuteers.  
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank you,
    Ali Hall
