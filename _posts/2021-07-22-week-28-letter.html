    I spent all week learning about <a href="environmental-impact-of-fast-fashion.html" target="__blank">
    fast fashion and it's shockingly negative impact on the environment</a>. While I've made the 
    decisions to make my closet more sustainable by <a href="where-to-find-secondhand-clothing.html" target="__blank">
    shopping for secondhand clothes</a>, my personal impact is miniscule in comparison to large brands and corporations. 
    That's why, this week, I'm writing to popular department store, Macy's, and asking that they 
    move away from fast fashion and work towards carrying more sustainable clothing brands.

    Good afternoon,
  </p>

  <p>
    My name is Ali and I have been shopping at Macy's for as long as I can remember. I have nothing 
    but great memories of not only the department stores, but also the Thanksgiving Day Parade, and the 4th of 
    July fireworks show in NYC. The name "Macy's" takes me right back to some of the happiest times in my life.
  </p>

  <p>
    
    This year, my concern for the environment has increased immensely, and in an effort to reduce 
    my carbon footprint, I resolved to shrink my waste by making one small change every week. 
    This week, I took a long look at my shopping habit and the fashion industry and I was mortified to 
    learn about the negative impact of fast fashion on our planet. So, I am writing to see if you will 
    work towards phasing out fast fashion and carrying more sustainable brands in your stores. 
  </p>

  <p>
    According to the EPA, textiles make up nearly 8% of landfill waste. In 2018, The U.S. sent 9,070,000 
    tons of clothing and shoes to landfills. On average, a person in the US throws away 
    81 pounds of clothing every year. And to make matters even worse, clothing is often made of
    synthetic materials like nylon, polyester, and acrylic, which are all petroleum based, aka plastic. 
    These materials can take hundreds of years to break down.
  </p>

  <p>
    Beyond contributing massive amounts of waste, fast fashion uses up natural resources, like water. 
    Garment manufacturing is responsible for 20% of global waste water. Synthetic materials, like nylon 
    and polyester, need less water than their land-grown alternatives, but their production releases 
    more greenhouse gasses per kilogram. It's estimated that the clothing industry emits 
    10% of global CO2 emissions. 
  </p>

  <p>
    I realize that no changes can be made overnight, but by holding brands accountable and encouraging 
    sustainable "slow fashion", Macy's would certainly make a difference in the fashion world. It's no 
    secret that climate change is on the verge of threatening our most basic daily tasks and I'm 
    certain your patrons would be thrilled to see Macy's take a stand for the environment.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sincerely,
  </p>

  <p>
    Ali Hall
