    There's a reason I've waited so long to address paper towels

<h2>Isn't paper biodegradable?</h2>
<p>
  It is, but when sent to a landfill, paper towels can take <a href="https://www.saveonenergy.com/material-decomposition/" target="__blank">
  a month to break down</a>.

<h2>Are there any other problems with paper towels?</h2>

<h3>Paper Waste</h3>
<p>
  In <a href="https://www.studyfinds.org/average-american-toilet-paper/" target="__blank">
  one survey</a> of 2,000 Americans, adults used an average of 145 rolls of paper towels every year. 
  In total, Americans use an estimated <a href="https://oceanconservancy.org/blog/2012/10/12/paper-towels-whats-the-big-deal-anyway/" target="__blank">
  13 billion pounds</a> of paper towels annually.  And according to the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2021-01/documents/2018_tables_and_figures_dec_2020_fnl_508.pdf" target="__blank">
  EPA</a>, tissue paper and paper towels contributed 7.58 billion pounds of MSW (Municipal Solid Waste) in 2018.

<h3>Water Waste</h3>

<h3>Deforestation</h3>
<p>
  I want to briefly go over the negative effects of deforestation as mentioned in an article by <a href="https://sciencing.com/four-consequences-deforestation-7622.html" target="__blank">
  Sciencing.com:</a>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Greenhouse Gas Emissions - Greenhouse gases such as methane and carbon dioxide are the leading cause of climate change.
      Trees release oxygen and absorb carbon dioxide... unless they are cut down.
    </li>

    <li>
      Soil Erosion - Roots from trees and other plants keep soil compact. When forests are removed, 
      the soil loses it's anchor, making way for erosion and in serious cases, disastrous mudslides. 
    </li>

    <li>
      Water Cycle Disruption - Trees soak up water from the ground which they release into the atmosphere 
      during photosynthesis. That moisture eventually becomes rain, which goes back into the ground and our oceans.
      When large swaths of trees are removed, the land can become barren and dry.
    </li>

    <li>
      Biodiversity Losses - Deforestation alters the landscape too quickly for plants and animals to cope, so 
      many do not survive.
    </li>
  </ul>

<h2>Can paper towels be recycled?</h2>
<p>
  Paper towels are not generally accepted for recycling since the fibers are not sufficient to make new products. 
  The cardboard tubes, however, can and should be recycled or repurposed.
