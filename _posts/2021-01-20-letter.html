  <p>This week I'm trying to put an end to all that unwanted mail clogging my mailbox, which includes brochures
    and updates from charity organizations. Here is a letter I wrote to a charity that I support asking to be 
    removed from their mailing list.

    Hello!
  </p>

  <p>
    My name is Alexandra Hall and I am huge supporter of Heifer International. I have been donating annually
    for the past four years and will continue to do so for as long as I can. However, I would like to be taken 
    off of your mailing list. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Most of your mailers end up in my junk mail pile, so I would prefer to be contacted only once per year. 
    If my mailing information is on a separate organization's subscription list, please let me know so I 
    can contact them directly.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank you for your time and for offering such hopeful opportunities for so many people.
  </p>

  <p>
    Alexandra Hall
