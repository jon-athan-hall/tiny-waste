    This week I learned about <a href="environmental-impact-of-lip-balm.html" target="__blank">the environmental impact of lip balm</a> 
    and how both the plastic packaging and petroleum based ingredients are problematic. I made a list of <a href="10-sustainable-lip-balm-options" target="__blank">
    sustainable lip balm options</a>, but there are still plenty of companies that need us consumers to ask for change. 
    Burt's Bees already already uses all-natural ingredients for their products, but everything is still packaged in plastic. 
    So, this week's letter requesets that they phase out plastics and offer low-waste 
    lip balm options. Use this template to write to your favorite lip balm brand.

  Good afternoon,
  </p>
  
  <p>
  My name is Ali and Burt's Bees lip balm is my family's favorite since it uses all natural ingredients instead of 
  those icky petroleum based ones. This year, I’m making a conscious change to reduce my 
  carbon footprint and I’ve started to notice how much waste I’ve been contributing to our 
  earth. This includes waste from your plastic lip balm tubes.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  I’m writing to see if you’ll consider making a more environmentally friendly lip balm.  I know 
  that you offer a recycling program via Terracycle, but that feels like a temporary solution since the EPA has reported that only 8% of plastics are 
  actually recycled. The rest end up in landfills, where they will take hundreds of years to break down, 
  or in our waterways, where they break down into microplastics that cause 100,000 marine animal deaths every year. In fact, 
  it’s estimated that by 2050, there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish. Not to mention the manufacturing of plastic 
  uses oil and causes pollution.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  I’m aware that nothing can happen overnight, but at least working towards phasing out plastics 
  would be a huge step in the right direction. Perhaps you could look into compostable paperboard tubes or 
  infinitely recyclable glass and metal tins.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  It's no secret that plastics have become increasingly problematic and our earth is suffering 
  from the exorbitant amount of waste produced by humans. More and more people are becoming aware 
  of these issues and working towards a brighter, cleaner future for the next generation, so 
  I'm certain your consumers would be thrilled to see Burt's Bees take a stand in reducing waste and
  protecting our environment.

  Thank you for your time,
  </p>
