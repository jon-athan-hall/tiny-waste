    When my husband and I decided to hike the Appalachian Trail for our honeymoon, we learned 
    that the average person requires 5-7 months to thru-hike all 2,200 miles.
    Since we wanted to make sure we could take at least six months off of work, we adjusted nearly 
    every aspect of our spending. Instead of buying paper towels, we cleaned with cloth rags that could be 
    washed and reused.<!--more--> Rather than buy new clothes for a friend's wedding, we found secondhand duds at Goodwill. 
    And when my thighs worked overtime to put holes in my nice jeans, I sewed them up and kept wearing them.
    Little did we know, these frugal practices were the start of our low-waste lifestyle.

  <h1>Here are the 6 low-waste habits that have saved my family tons of money.</h1>

  <h2>We don't buy things we don't need.</h2>
  <p>
    Gone are the days of frivilous spending and "retail therapy", every purchase we make is a conscious one. 
    We stick to the basics, with a few thoughtful treats here and there.
  </p>

<section>
  <h2>We use what we have.</h2>
  <p>
    It's always tempting to buy the latest and greatest, but we use our belongings until they are no longer 
    in working order. In the same vein, before making a sustainable swap, we finish off every bit of the product.

  <h2>We repair our belongings to extend their lifepan.</h2>
  <p>
    Before we toss anything in the garbage, we try to repair it first. We patch worn out clothing, 
    mend broken XXX, and service appliances/machinary in order to keep them functioning as long as possible.
  </p>

<section>
  <h2>We opt for reusables.</h2>
  <p>
    Instead of wasting money on single-use items, we purchase things that can be use multiple 
    times without needing a replacement. Making the switch to 
    <a href="low-waste-shaving-options.html" target="__blank">safety razors</a>, 
    <a href="sustainable-paper-towel-options.html" target="__blank">cloth paper towels</a>, 
    <a href="feminine-hygiene-options.html" target="__blank">reusable menstrual products</a>, and 
    <a href="reusable-bottle-comparison.html" target="__blank">refillable water bottles</a>
    had a higher initial cost than their disposable counterparts, but have saved so much money in the long run.

  <h2>We shop secondhand.</h2>
  <p>
    When there is something we need to buy, we can usually find it secondhand for a fraction of the cost. 
    Last year, I saved thousands of dollars by thrifting my entire maternity closet and purchasing only 
    previously used baby goods.

  <h2>We are mindful of resource use.</h2>
  <p>
    Low-waste living isn't just about curbside garbage, it also requires being mindful of resources, like 
    water and electricity. Making steps to reduce the amount of resources we use helps keep our monthly 
    utility bills as low as possible.
