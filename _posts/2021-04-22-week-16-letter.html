    The deodorant industry produces over <a href=“https://lifeat.helmm.com/plastic-waste-from-single-use-deodorant/“ target=“__blank”>
    15 million pounds</a> of plastic waste every year and they should be held accountable for it. This 
    week's letter is to leading deodorant brand, Degree, requesting more sustainable deodorant tubes. Please

    Good afternoon,
    </p>
    
    <p>
    My name is Ali and I’ve been using Dove deodorant since I went through puberty 
    in middle school. Now, two decades later, I’ve been making a conscious change to reduce my 
    carbon footprint and I’ve started to notice how much waste I’ve been contributing to our 
    precious earth. This includes waste from your deodorant sticks.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    I’m writing to see if you’ll consider making your deodorant tubes from a material other 
    than plastic. The mixed plastics mean your empty sticks cannot be recycled. Even if they were 
    recyclable, the EPA has reported that only 8% of plastics are actually recycled. The rest end up 
    in landfills, where they will take hundreds of years to break down, or in our waterways, where 
    they break down into microplastics that cause 100,000 marine animal deaths every year. In fact, 
    it’s estimated that by 2050, there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    I’m aware that nothing can happen overnight, but at least working towards phasing out plastics 
    would be a huge step in the right direction. I’ve seen other natural brands use compostable 
    cardboard, infinitely recyclable aluminum, or no packaging at all, making them significantly more 
    sustainable.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    It's no secret that plastics have become increasingly problematic and our earth is suffering 
    from the exorbitant amount of waste produced by humans. More and more people are becoming aware 
    of these issues and working towards a brighter, cleaner future for the next generation, so 
    I'm certain your consumers would be thrilled to see Dove take a stand in protecting our 
    environment.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Thank you for you time,
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Ali Hall
