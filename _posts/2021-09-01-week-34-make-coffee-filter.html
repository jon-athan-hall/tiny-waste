    Since <a href="environmental-impact-of-coffee-and-tea.html" target="__blank">coffee and tea</a> are a consistent 
    part of my daily consumption, I want to make sure I'm being as sustainable as possible. Fortunately, there are plenty of  
    <a href="low-waste-tea-and-coffee-options.html" target="__blank">low-waste products</a> for brewing both coffee and tea.
    I found out that my local organic grocery store offers bulk coffee beans and loose leaf tea, which eliminates 
    packaging waste and now, I steep my tea leaves in a <a href="https://www.zulaykitchen.com/collections/all-products/products/tea-ball-infuser?ref=1NVBO" target="__blank">
    tea ball</a>. As for coffee, I still use my drip machine, but I've made a few reusable cloth filters to use 
    in place of disposable paper ones.
  </p>

  <p> 
    This project is extremely easy and takes about 15 minutes to make.

  <h3>How to use your coffee filter</h3>
  <p>
    First, wash and dry your filter. Use it the same way you would a normal filter, only after the 
    coffee is finished brewing, rinse until the water runs clear and hang to dry. Every few weeks, 
    give your filter a more thorough washing.
