    The deodorant industry produces over <a href=“https://lifeat.helmm.com/plastic-waste-from-single-use-deodorant/“ target=“__blank”>
    15 million pounds</a> of plastic waste every year. Of course, one way to eliminate cut down deodorant waste 
    is to simply stop using it. Now, I'm aware of my first world privilege here, but I can't imagine life 
    without deodorant. If I had to choose between make-up, hair products, clothes, or deodorant for the rest of 
    my life, deodorant would win hands down. Instead of giving it up completely, I've found ten 
    sustainable options that eliminate my deodorant plastic waste contribution.

    It may take a few tries to find the deodorant that works best for you and your skin. Perhaps find a 
    friend or family member also looking to make the switch so you can try eachother's purchases. If you 
    find that your armpits are easily irritated, try an option without baking-soda. Be advised that switching 
    to an  all natural deodorant may require a few weeks of detox before your armpits stop smelling 
    completely. During this time, I recommend keeping your deodorant on hand and reapplying often.

      <h3>No Tox Life</h3>

        <a href="https://notoxlife.com/collections/deodorants/products/deodorant-desert-rose-citrus-extra-strength-odor-control-zero-waste" target="__blank">
        No Tox Life</a> is my go-to for sustainable deodorant since it is plastic-free, cruelty-free, and made from 
        all natural, plant-based ingredients. I brought a bar of No Tox Life deodorant on my Appalachian Trail 
        thru-hike last year and was blown away by how well it worked on my husband and I who were sweating all 
        day long and only showering once a week. This deodorant bar comes without any extra packaging, so you 
        simply have to pick it up and apply as you would normal deodorant. It should be kept in an air-tight 
        container so it stays moist and easy to apply. You can find it online; $7.98 for a 1 oz bar or $14.98 for 
        a 3.5 oz bar.

        <a href="https://littleseedfarm.com/collections/deodorant/products/deodorant-cream-3-scents" target="__blank">
        Little Seed Farm</a> is another popular choice among some of my low-waste friends and family members. It is still 
        plastic-free, cruelty-free, and vegan, but the ingredients don't irritate their sensitive skin. Little Seed Farm 
        deodorant cream is $10.00 for a 2.4 oz glass jar with metal lid. It can be applied with your fingers or you can opt to buy 
        a bamboo applicator. Oh, and they offer <a href="https://littleseedfarm.com/collections/deodorant/products/natural-organic-free-deodorant-cream-sample-travel" target="__blank">free samples</a>!
