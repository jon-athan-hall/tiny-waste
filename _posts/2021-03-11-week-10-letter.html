    Take-out is a lifesaver for many of us, so it's not realistic to do away with it completely. Instead, 
    we can try to make take-out containers a little more sustainable. Here is a letter template for 
    asking your favorite take-out restaurant to switch to aluminum containers with paper board tops.
    Aluminum is infinitely recyclable and paper board is biodegradable, so this change could make 
    a big difference in the amount of waste we send to landfills.

    Good afternoon!
  </p>

  <p>
    I hope you and your staff have been doing well during this crazy year. Thai Express is my family's 
    favorite option for take-out. We absolutely love your Drunken Noodles and Green Curry.

  <p>
    This year I'm resolving to "shrink my waste", so I've been extra aware of the plastic I come in contact
    with on a daily basis, including all the take-out containers I get from your restaurant. 
    I recently found out that plastic takes hundreds of years to break down and only 9% 
    gets recycled. I also learned that paper take-out cups are actually lined with plastic, so they aren't recyclable 
    or biodegradable. Currently, 8 million tons of plastic winds up in the ocean each year. Most of that is single-use 
    plastic which is responsible for killing over a 100,000 marine animals annually.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm writing to ask if Thai Express would consider switching to a more sustainable take away container. 
    Aluminum containers with paper board tops would be a great alternative since aluminum is 
    infinitely recyclable and paper board is biodegradable.
  </p>

  <p>
    I know more and more people are becoming aware of environmental issues and I'm certain your
    customers would love to see you take a more sustainable approach to food delivery. 
  </p>

  <p>
    I hope you'll consider this request from a loyal patron.
  </p>

    Thank you,
