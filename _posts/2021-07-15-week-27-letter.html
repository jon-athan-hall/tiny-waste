    Dear [local representative],
  </p>
  <p>
    I am writing to express my concern about the imminent threat climate change poses to our 
    country, to our people and the future of our children. An overwhelming number of 
    scientists agree, and signs abound that climate change is occurring much faster than 
    was initially predicted. We have only a few critical years before the changes become 
    irreversible.
  </p>

  <p>
    More than 2,000 scientists contributing to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
    (IPCC) have made it clear that cuts of at least 50% to 70% in global greenhouse gas 
    emissions are necessary to allow our climate to re-stabilise. Therefore, the Government 
    should be making every effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions â€“ now.
  </p>

  <p>
    Specifically, I believe you should act to address the issues below, and I ask you to 
    provide me with information on what the government is doing to reduce greenhouse gas 
    emissions in the following areas:
  </p>

  <p>
    <ol>
      <li>Reducing carbon dioxide emissions from coal fired power plants</li>
      <li>Reducing emissions from the transport sector</li>
      <li>Funding initiatives for alternative and renewable energy technology</li>
      <li>Incentives for the uptake of renewable energy</li>
      <li>Removal of subsidies for fossil based fuel sources</li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  <p>
    To secure a future for our nation and our children now is the time to set a new 
    and positive direction for our national energy policy. We need policies that will 
    lead our nation away from fossil based fuels.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our addiction to fossil fuel harms human health, causes global warming, degrades land 
    and marine ecosystems, and pollutes the earth. We need energy systems that provide clean, 
    renewable, and reliable energy that does not threaten human health or the environment. 
    We do create our futures, and not to reach for it would be a gross abdication of our 
    moral responsibility.
  </p>

  <p>
    I understand that focusing on climate change is just one of many issues during these 
    challenging times. However, we can not wait until tomorrow we must take strong action 
    now to address the daunting issues that climate change poses.
  </p>
