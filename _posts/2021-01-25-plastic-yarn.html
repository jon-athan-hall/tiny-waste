  <ol>
    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="4-plastic-bags/1-flatten-bag.jpg" %}
      <p>
        Flatten your plastic bag.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="4-plastic-bags/2-cut-bottom.jpg" %}
      <p>
        Fold the bag in half hot dog style and cut the bottom seam off.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="4-plastic-bags/3-cut-top.jpg" %}
      <p>
        With the bag still folded, cut the top handles off.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="4-plastic-bags/4-spread-tube.jpg" %}
      <p>
        Spread the bag out to find a tube shape and flatten.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="4-plastic-bags/5-fold-up.jpg" %}
      <p>
        Fold the closed edge up about an inch below the  other closed edge.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="4-plastic-bags/6-cut-strips.jpg" %}
      <p>
        Cut half inch strips starting from the fold and going just past the edge of the top layer.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="4-plastic-bags/7-cut-all.jpg" %}
      <p>
        Continue cutting strips until you've reached the other end of the bag. 
        They don't need to be perfect.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="4-plastic-bags/8-find-tube.jpg" %}
      <p>
        Find your tube the same way you did in step 4.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="4-plastic-bags/9-find-spine.jpg" %}
      <p>
        Put a piece of cardboard or anything to help keep your tube orderly.
        You should have what looks like a spine on top.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="4-plastic-bags/10-diagonal-cuts.jpg" %}
      <p>
        Make diagonal cuts going from the right edge of your bottom strips, to the right edge
        of it's neighboring top strip.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="4-plastic-bags/11-roll-plarn.jpg" %}
      <p>
        When all of your diagonal cuts are made, you should have one continuous strip. Roll it up
        as you would regular yarn.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="4-plastic-bags/12-finished-plarn.jpg" %}
      <p>
        You've saved a bag from the landfill, now go forth and make something with your new plarn!
      </p>
