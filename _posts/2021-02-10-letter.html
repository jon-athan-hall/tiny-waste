    This week I learned a lot about the pros and cons of straw bans. As pointed out in every other Week 6 post,
    there are plenty of pros to banning single-use plastic bags. However, there is one big con: some people with certain 
    disabilities require straws. This is why most plastic straw bans are not actual bans, but 
    "By Request Only" policies.

    Kathryn Kellog of <a href="https://www.goingzerowaste.com/" target="__blank">
    Going Zero Waste</a> has been writing about waste reduction for years. In fact, she authored 
    "101 Ways to Go Zero Waste" which was the first book I read when I started noticing all of the 
    garbage in my life. In it, she shares the following letter template, to be referenced when 
    requesting that your favorite restaurant apply a single-use plastic straw ban.

    In her <a href="https://www.goingzerowaste.com/blog/how-to-address-businesses-about-their-packaging-and-eco-friendly-initiatives-scripts/" target="__blank"> 
    blog</a>, she points out that not only is the "By Request Only" policy better for the planet, but 
    it also saves the restaurant money!

    Good morning,
  </p>

  <p>
    I hope you’re doing well. Diner Town is one of my favorite places to grab lunch; 
    the pecan pie is my absolute fave! During my last visit, I couldn’t help but notice 
    that straws are automatically placed in all of the drinks. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Straws and single-use plastic in general have been getting a lot of media attention. 
    France has done away with single-use plastic cups and cutlery so has Seattle. 
    Even McDonald’s is looking for plastic straw alternatives. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Straws may seem small, but it adds up. In the US alone, we use 500 million plastic straws everyday! 
  </p>

  <p>
    Currently, 8 million tons of plastic winds up in the ocean each year. Most of that is single-use 
    plastic which is responsible for killing over a 100,000 marine animals annually. 
  </p>

  <p>
    I would like to ask that Diner Town, adopt a straw on request only policy. This means that 
    straws aren’t automatically put into drinks or advertised. Instead, they are only handed out when 
    a customer specifically asks for one. 
  </p>

  <p>
    This will significantly decrease the amount of straws you go through having a positive 
    affect on the environment and the bottom line. 
  </p>

  <p>
    I really hope you’ll take my request under consideration. thank you! 
  </p>

  <p>
    Sincerely, 
  </p>

  <p>
    Kathryn
