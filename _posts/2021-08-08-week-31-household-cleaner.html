    Last week, I focused specifically on <a href="environmental-impact-of-bathroom-cleaners.html" target="__blank">
    bathroom cleaners</a>, but what about cleaning products in the rest of the house? I use a multi-surface 
    spray in every other room, so it should definitely be safe for both my health and the environment.
