    This week, I focused on the <a href="environmental-impact-of-baking-materials.html" target="__blank">
    environmental impact of common baking materials</a>. While I've found 
    <a href="low-waste-baking-tips.html" target="__blank">a few ways to bake more sustainably</a>, 
    I want to make sure large companies are being held accountable for the waste their products contribute 
    to our landfills. So, this week I'm writing to

    Good afternoon,
  </p>

  <p>
   My name is Ali and my family and I have been XXXfanatics for over a decade now. 
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm writing because this year, I made a resolution to reduce the amount of waste I produce and realized 
    that your plastic pods are one of our biggest contributions.

    since only 8% of plastics are actually recycled.  The rest end up in landfills, where they will take 
    hundreds of years to decompose, or in our waterways, where they break down into microplastics that 
    cause 100,000 marine animal deaths every year. Not to mention the manufacturing of plastic 
    uses oil and causes pollution.

  <p>
    Iâ€™m aware that nothing can happen overnight, but at least working towards eliminating plastics 
    would be a huge step in the right direction. Perhaps you could look into XXX

  <p>
    It's no secret that plastics have become increasingly problematic and our earth is suffering 
    from the exorbitant amount of waste produced by humans. More and more people are becoming aware 
    of these issues and working towards a brighter, cleaner future for the next generation.
    I'm sure your consumers would be thrilled to see Keurig take such a strong approach to reducing 
    waste and protecting our planet.

  <p>
    Sincerely,
