    This week, we took a look at <a href="environmental-impact-of-paper-towels.html" target="__blank">
    the environmental impact of paper towels</a> and found a few<a href="sustainable-paper-towel-options.html" target="__blank">
    sustainable paper towel options</a> to cut back on all that paper waste. While individual actions 
    are important, we all know that large companies must be held accountable if we have any home of seeing 
    real change. So, this week's letter goes to Brawny, a leading brand in the paper towel industry, 
    asking that they make their product using recycled material instead of virgin pulp.<!--more-->

  <p>
    Good afternoon,
  </p>

  <p>
    My name is Ali and 
  </p>

  <p>
    This year, I made a resolution to reduce my carbon footprint by making gradual changes. And now that my husand 
    and I are expecting our first child in October, I'm especially concerned about keeping the planet safe for future generations. 
    This week, I started looking at my paper towel use and how much paper waste I create on a daily basis. 
  </p>

  <p> 
    According to the EPA, tissue paper and paper towels contributed 7.58 billion pounds of MSW 
    (Municipal Solid Waste) in 2018. Since most tissue paper and paper towels are made with virgin pulp, water waste and 
    deforestation are also huge concerns. I've seen on your website that Brawny 
    uses sustainable forestry, but that feels like a mere bandaid on a much larger problem. 
    So, I'm writing to see if Brawny would consider making paper towels from post-consumer recycled pulp 
    instead. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Iâ€™m aware that nothing can happen overnight, but at least working towards more sustainanble practices
    would be a huge step in the right direction. Perhaps you could also look into making reusable paper 
    towels.
  
  <p>
    It's no secret that landfill bound waste, deforestation, and water shortages have become increasingly 
    problematic. More and more people are becoming aware 
    of these issues and working towards a brighter, cleaner future for the next generation.
    I'm sure your consumers would be thrilled to see Brawny take such a strong approach to protecting our planet. 
  <p>

  <p>
    Sincerely,
  </p>

  <p>
    Ali Hall
