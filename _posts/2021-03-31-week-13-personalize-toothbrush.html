    Bamboo toothbrushes are much better for the environment than their plastic counterparts. However, they 
    often lack the distinguishing features, like color, that make them easy to tell apart. I share almost  
    everything with my husband, but I draw the line at swapping toothbrushes.

  <p>
    My first thought was to paint them different colors, but adding paint would mean it can no longer go into my 
    compost bin. I also didn't want to risk adding any chemicals with a sharpie marker. I considered trying 
    to dye them with natural colors like beet juice, but didn't think the bamboo would hold the color very well. 
    Ultimately, I decided to use a wood-burning tool that could make cute designs without sacrificing the integrity 
    of the bamboo.

    This project took about 15 minutes, but could take more or less time depending on the intricacy of your 
    design and your comfort level with a wood-burning tool.

  <h4>What You'll Need:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Wood Burning Tool - These range from $15-$50. I have the <a href="https://www.joann.com/walnut-hollow-creative-versa-tool-kit/6592547.html" target="__blank">
      Walnut Hollow Creative Versa-Tool</a> which I got at a Joann Fabric and Crafts. It sells for $35, but 
      Joann always has coupons online so I used %40 off one single item and saved $14. 
    </li>
    <li>Bamboo Toothbrush - You can use any kind, but I highly recommend the ones from <a href="https://notoxlife.com/products/bamboo-toothbrush" target="__blank">
      No Tox Life</a> as they are inexpensive and offer a nice flat surface to work with.
    </li>
    <li>Pencil - to sketch the design before burning.</li>
  </ul>

      <p>
        1. Decide which tip will work best for your design and change it out before turning on your
        wood-burning tool. Use pliers to twist the tip off and on. You can use mutiple tips, but 
        always wait for the tool to cool completely before changing them out.

      <p>
        2. Plug in your wood-burning tool so it has plenty of time to heat up. I found that the higher settings 
        worked best for this project.

        3. Using a pencil, sketch your design on the toothbrush. You can write a name, draw or picture, or 
        simply create a pattern. If you have kids, maybe they would like to draw a little design on there. Get creative!
