  <p>Boy oh boy, plastic water bottles. Where do I begin? </p>
  
  <p>The US alone consumes <a href="https://www.aiga.org/case-study-watershed#:~:text=Watershed%20is%20an%20eco%2Dart,informational%20signs%20regarding%20this%20consumption." target="__blank">
    1,500</a> plastic water bottles every second and <a href="https://myequa.com/blogs/blog/89626311-facts-about-plastic-bottles" target="__blank">38 billion</a>
    end up in a landfill <em>every year</em>. Globally, humans buy 
    <a href="https://www.earthday.org/fact-sheet-single-use-plastics/" target="__blank">
    1,000,000</a> plastic bottles per minute.</p><!--more-->

  <h2 class="highlight">Cost Difference</h2>

  <p>Now, let's talk economics. Bottled water costs <a href="https://myequa.com/blogs/blog/89626311-facts-about-plastic-bottles" target="__blank">
    1,000 times</a> more than tap water. In fact, 90% of the cost is for the bottle. In other words, when we purchase bottled water, we are 
    basically just paying for a plastic bottle. Families could save <a href="https://home.howstuffworks.com/save-money-with-water-filter.htm#:~:text=And%20when%20you%20consider%20that,four%20down%20to%20just%20%241.10." target="__blank">
    hundreds of dollars</a> every year by drinking filtered tap water instead.
  </p>

  <h2 class="main">Environmental Impact</h2>

  <p>But the reason we're all here is for the environmental impact and trust me when I tell 
    you, it's not pretty. You may start to notice a little repition here, but plastic never decomposes. 
    It only breaks down into little bitty baby micro and nanoplastics that have infiltrated nearly 
    every aspect of life on earth. Plastic particles have been found at the bottom of the sea, in our soil, 
    and in the air we breath . According to <a href="https://www.audubon.org/news/microplastics-are-literally-raining-our-national-parks-and-wilderness-areas#:~:text=on%20mobile%20device-,Microplastics%20Are%20Literally%20Raining%20on%20Our%20National%20Parks%20and%20Wilderness,protected%20areas%20in%20the%20West." target="__blank">
    one study</a>, "up to 300 million plastic bottles' worth of of plastic particles per year landed 
    on 11 remote protected areas in the West." Like I said...<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2019/06/you-eat-thousands-of-bits-of-plastic-every-year/" target="__blank">
    everywhere.</a>
  </p>

  <h2 class="highlight">Health Issues</h2>
  <p>
    On a more personal level, <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/toxic-chemicals-substances/most-plastic-products-contain-potentially-toxic-chemicals/" target="__blank">
    studies</a> have shown that plastic leeches toxins into the water, which has been linked to various health
    problems including <a href="https://www.ciel.org/project-update/plastic-and-human-health-a-lifecycle-approach-to-plastic-pollution/#:~:text=99%25%20of%20plastic%20comes%20from%20fossil%20fuels.&text=Over%20170%20fracking%20chemicals%20that,the%20immune%20system%2C%20and%20more." target="__blank">
    cancer and reproductive issues</a>. As someone who is currently trying to start a family, I found this 
    more than a little horrifying.

  <h2 class="main">What Can I Use Instead?</h2>
  <p>There are hundreds of reusable water bottle options out there and you might already 
    own one that has been hiding in the pantry. If you don't have one, 
    consider <a href="make-reusable-water-bottle" target="__blank">upcycling a glass jar or 
    screw top bottle</a>. You <em>do not</em> need to spend any money to make a difference. 
    Of course, if you are set on buying a bottle to jumpstart this new habit, you can read 
    my <a href="bottle-comparison.html" target="__blank">pros and cons</a> for each material.
    And if you really want to keep a stash of disposable water bottles, you can switch to 
    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Koz-Water-24-Pack-Canned-Purified/dp/B084LRJJ33/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?dchild=1&keywords=canned+water&qid=1612193363&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUE1SFZJNEpRSVo5TlAmZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTAwMTg4MjUxMTE1QVFUVDAzSllDJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA4Nzc0MzAyWU9BOFpQUFpGOEk4JndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==" target="__blank">
    canned water</a>!

  <h2 class="highlight">Is Tap Water Safe to Drink?</h2>
  <p>According to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/drinking/drinking-water-faq.html" target="__blank">
    CDC</a>, all public water systems in the United States are required to follow the standards 
    and regulations set by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency. Federal law requires that 
    systems reduce certain contaminants to set levels in order to protect human health. So, yes, most 
    tap water in the US is safe to drink, but you can be extra sure by using a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/drinking/home-water-treatment/water-filters.html" target="__blank">
    water filter</a>.</p>

  <h2 class="main">What about the Case of Water I just Bought?</h2>
  <p>Definitely drink what you've got and recycle or <a href="https://thekrazycouponlady.com/tips/at-home/12-incredible-ways-to-reuse-plastic-water-bottles?epik=dj0yJnU9YTI1YlZHeVdyOWp0ajBvZHNRWjduam45UHR5XzRVUkQmcD0wJm49U0xBMUZCcHJrdHlEbnpfRFphMHdtdyZ0PUFBQUFBR0FYTlVv" target="__blank">
    upcycle</a> the bottles. Or, consider donating them to a homeless shelter, since not everyone 
    is lucky enough to have access to running water.
