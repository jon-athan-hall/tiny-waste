    We all know the importance of dental hygiene and most of us brush our teeth
    at least twice a day. If you're doing it right, you're even replacing your 
    toothbrush every 3-4 months, as recommended by the American Dental Association. That means we 
    got through a lot of toothbrushes. In fact, the average adult uses and throws away about <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/story-of-plastic-toothbrushes" target="__blank">
    300 toothbrushes</a> in his or her lifetime. And if you laid out the number of toothbrushes thrown out 
    in the US every year, they would wrap around Earth four times!

  <h4>What's Wrong With Toothbrushes?</h4>
  <p>
    Most toothbrushes are made of plastic, which takes hundreds of years to break down. Plastics are 
    made from non-renewable, patroleum based fossil fuels that release toxins when burned. Even the 
    bristols are made of nylon, a synthetic, non-biodegradable material. Because plastic is made to be 
    indestructable, basically every toothbrush made since the 1930's <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/story-of-plastic-toothbrushes"
    target="__blank">still exists</a> as a piece of trash.

  <h4>Can toothbrushes be recycled?</h4>
  <p>
    While you can't throw your old toothbrushes into the curbside recycling bin, they can be recycling through 
    a program sponsored by <a href="https://www.terracycle.com/en-US/brigades/colgate#@40.77027075200147:-95.93705549677736zoom:4" target="__blank">
    Terracycle and Colgate</a>. All you have to do is print out a free shipping label, slap it on a box, and put it in the mail. 
    You can send all brands of used or empty toothpaste tubes and caps, toothbrushes, toothpaste cartons, 
    toothbrush outer packaging, and floss containers. However, electric toothbrushes, battery operated toothbrushes, 
    and their parts cannot be recycled through this program

  <h4>Is there a sustainable toothbrush option?</h4>
  <p>
    There sure is! Your most sustainable option is a bamboo toothbrush. Bamboo grows quickly and is 100% biodegradable and typically 
    backyard compostable, though you'll have to break off the head or remove the bristles, since they are usually made of nylon.
    Popular brands inclue Georganics, The Humble Co., and Brush with Bamboo. Or, if you're looking for a 100% plant-based 
    option, try <a href="https://bitetoothpastebits.com/products/brush" target="__blank">Bite</a>. The handle is still made 
    from bamboo, but the bristles are made from the castor bean plant.
  </p>

  <p>
    I've seen bamboo toothbrushes at Target, on Amazon and even at our local grocery store. You can also order from <a href="https://packagefreeshop.com/collections/all/products/bamboo-toothbrush-adult">
    Package Free Shop</a>, to ensure plastic free delivery. Before you purchase anything, make sure the handle is 100% bamboo, rather than 
    a mix of bamboo and synthetic material.
  </p>

  <p>Have a conversation with your dentist to make sure the changes you make are best for your oral care routine.
