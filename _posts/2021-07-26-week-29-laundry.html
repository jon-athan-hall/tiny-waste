    fast fashion's negative environmental impact</a>. So, naturally, it's time to delve into

  <h2>What negative impact does my laundry routine have on the environment?</h2>
  <p>

  </p>

  <h3>Water</h3>
  <p>
    Accoreding to <a href="https://www.energystar.gov/products/clothes_washers" target="__blank">Energy Star</a>, 
    conventional top-loading washing machines use around <a href="https://home.howstuffworks.com/washing-machine-water-usage1.htm" target="__blank">
    20 gallons of water per load. Since the average Amerian family does about 300 loads of laundry every year, your washing machine 
    is responsible for roughly 6,000 gallons of water waste every year. You may recall from my 
    <a href="importance-of-water-conservation.html" target="__blank">Week 26 post about water</a>,
    that we are on the verge of a global water shortage and that conservation is crucial since, already, <a href="https://inweh.unu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Global-Water-Crisis-The-Facts.pdf" target="__blank">
    844 million people</a> lack access to basic drinking water.

  </p>

  <h3>Electricity</h3>
  <p>
    Both washing machines and dryers require electricity to run. In <a href="environmental-impact-of-the-electricity-system.html" target="__blank">
    In Week 27, 
    
   
    Close to <a href="https://www.energystar.gov/products/laundry_best_practices" target="__blank">90 percent</a> 
    of the energy necessary to clean a load of laundry in a top-load washer is used to heat the water.
  </p>

  <h3>Detergent</h3>
  <p>

  </p>

  <h3>Fabric Softener</h3>
  <p>

  </p>

  <h3>Bleach</h3>
  <p>

  </p>

  <h3>Dryer Sheets</h3>
