    You don't have to completely give up ordering take-out to make a difference. Here are five habits 
    that can significantly reduce the amount of take away containers in your life.

      <h4>1. Start Meal Planning</h4>
      <p>
        Meal planning is probably the most effective way to avoid getting take-out. By planning 
        ahead, it's not as likely you'll have to rely on take away as a last minute fix. Meal planning 
        is also a great way to reduce food waste and financial waste.
      </p>

      <h4>2. Pack a Lunch</h4>
      <p>
        Packing a lunch doesn't have to be a huge ordeal. Make a sandwich or pack up some 
        leftovers to bring to work. 
      </p>
    
      <h4>3. Eat at the Restaurant</h4>
      <p>
        As Covid restrictions lift, I'm sure we'll all be anxious to get back to dining at our 
        favorite restaurants. Eating there instead of ordering your meal to go is a great way to 
        cut down on those pesky plastic containers.
      </p>
    
      <h4>4. Bring A Container to Restaurants</h4>
      <p>
        If you typically have leftovers to take home, bring a container to put them in. This way, 
        you won't have to use a to-go box from the restaurant.
      </p>
    
      <h4>5. Set A Limit</h4>
      <p>
        By simply setting a limit on the amount of take-out you allow yourself, you can cut down 
        on the amount of containers you go through. If you currently get take-out once a week, see if 
        you can handle once a month instead.
