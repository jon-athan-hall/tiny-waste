    This week I made easy to understand recycling bins! 
  </p>

  <p>My township offers a single stream curbside recycling program, which means I can put all of my 
    recyclables in one bin. <a href="/week-1-wishful-recycling.html" targt="_blank">This does not mean
    that everything can be recycled.</a> 
    My husband and I will likely be able to remember our local requirements, but I wanted to make sure 
    everyone else entering our home can easily navigate our recycling set up.

  <h2>Let's make some recycling bins</h2>
  <p> 
    I bought four small trash cans from Lowes for about $5 each and made labels with some sticky permanent vinyl sheets
    I already had. You can use ANY kind of container for this...cardboard boxes, storage bins, buckets...just make sure 
    it's big enough to hold your recyclables.

    These instructions are specifically for <a href=" https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=567915&u=2847584&m=51766&urllink=&afftrack=" target="__blank">Cricut</a> users, but you definitely don't need a Cricut to make cute labels. 
    You could print them out and tape them up, make your own stencils, or simply write with a paint pen. The most 
    important thing is that your recycling bins are clearly labeled for everyone using them. I've included the images 
    I used to make my stickers, in case you'd like to be twinsies.

    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="1-curbside-recycling/MTC1-upload-image.jpg" alt="computer screen shot of uploading an image" %}
      <p>First, you'll upload the image you would like use. Make sure you remove the negative space. If you're 
        using mine, that would be all of the white areas.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="1-curbside-recycling/MTC1-size-image.jpg" alt="computer screen shot of sizing an image" %}
      <p>Size the image to fit on your intended surface. I made mine 5" wide, which by default made them about 5" tall. </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="1-curbside-recycling/MTC1-cricut-cut.jpg" alt="cricut machine cutting vinyl" %}
      <p>Make sure the image is set to "Linetype: Cut" and "Fill: No Fill", then click "Make It". You'll choose "Vinyl" as the 
        material and follow the steps on your screen.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="1-curbside-recycling/MTC1-remove-background.jpg" alt="vinyl negative space being removed" %}
      <p>Cut out your image so you have a smaller area to work with and remove the vinyl from the negative space.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="1-curbside-recycling/MTC1-use-pick.jpg" alt="small vinyl background areas being removed with a tool" %}
      <p>Use a weeder, toothpick or tweezers to help remove the smaller areas.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="1-curbside-recycling/MTC1-transfer-paper.jpg" alt="transfer tape being applied to vinyl image" %}
      <p>Cut your transfer tape or masking tape to fit your project size and tape over the vinyl. Tiny Waste Pro Tip: I used 
        one piece of transfer tape for all four bins.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="1-curbside-recycling/MTC1-pull-image.jpg" alt="vinyl image being removed from background" %}
      <p>Pull the tape away from the vinyl backing, making sure the vinyl sticks to the tape.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="1-curbside-recycling/MTC1-place-image.jpg" alt="vinyl image shown on recycling bin" %}
      <p>Line up the vinyl on your intended surface. Make note so all bins have the same placement.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="1-curbside-recycling/MTC1-remove-transfer-tape.jpg" alt="transfer tape being removed from vinyl image" %}
      <p>Slowly remove the transfer tape, making sure the vinyl stays on the bin.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      {% include image-source-set.html image="1-curbside-recycling/MTC1-finish.jpg" alt="completed look at paper recycling image on trash can" %}
      <p>Step back and admire your work, then teach everyone in your house how to start using your very clearly
        labeled bins!
