    This week I opted for a quick, but functional craft project - making specialty recycling bins for some of the 
    items that aren't accepted in my curbside pickup. You can use <em>any</em> containers, but might I suggest choosing
    some that can't be recycled and will end its life in a landfill. Think Pringles, Folgers, Panko Bread Crumbs...the ones 
    made up of multiple materials.

        1. Pick out a plastic or landfill-bound container. We jut happened to have multiple bread crumbs, 
        but you could use large yogurt cups, peanut butter jars...basically anything.

        3. With scissors, cut a hole in the lid. Make sure it is big enough to fit your intended recyclables.

        4. Use acrylic paint or plastic-friendly spray paint to color the lids. This step is completely optional. 
        I had black spray paint in my craft supplies, so I gave my lids a quick coat.

        5. Label your containers with a sharpie. You could have one for plastic bags, batteries, corks...

        6. Well, that took about five minutes and now my dead batteries have a home.
