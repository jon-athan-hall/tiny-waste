    Switching to a sustainable toothpaste may take a little more effort than simply changing toothbrushes, but 
    none of these options will drastically change your dental routine.  I, personally, love tablets, but 
    chewing on toothpaste may not be the best option for everyone. You should, of course, consult a dental 
    professional with any questions and to make sure your teeth are getting proper attention.

  <h2 class="highlight">Toothpaste Tablets</h2>
    <p>
      When it comes to zero waste toothpaste, tablets are hands down my favorite. There is no gel or 
      liquid, which means they are travel friendly and don't make a mess like traditional toothpaste. 
      All you do is pop the tablet it in your mouth and chew until foamy, then you're ready to brush!

        <a href="https://bitetoothpastebits.com/products/mint-subscription" target="__blank">
        Bite Toothpaste Bits</a> are my first choice for toothpaste tablets for multiple reasons. 
        The flavors, Fresh Mint, Berry Twist, and Mint Charcoal, all taste great. These bits come in 
        a recyclable glass jar with an aluminum lid and refills come in a backyard compostable baggie. 
        Bite bits are made from all natural ingredients and do not contain toxins like triclosan and fluoride. 
        And to top it off, Bite is vegan, meaning their products don't contain animal products, 
        and cruelty-free, meaning they don't test products on animals. Bite Bits are $30 for 258 tablets if you 
        have a subscription.

      instead of a tube, so all you do is dip your brush or use a small spoon to apply the paste to your bristles.
