    We order take-out to our home a few times every month and always end up with an 
    unnecessary napkin and plastic utensils. I don't know about you, but I have a drawer full of 
    unused cutlery bags. This week, we'll write a letter to our favorite take-out restaurant asking 
    to make those cutlery bags optional.

    Hello!
  </p>

  <p>
    My family loves Pizza Time and your meat lovers pie is a weekly staple in our house.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This year, I am trying to be more concious of the amount of waste I produce and I can't help but 
    notice that we always receive utensils and a napkin even though we are at home. Neither the napkins 
    or the utensils can be recycled, so they typically end up in a landfill. I learned recently that 
    paper takes 10-15 years to break down and plastic can take hundreds of years to break down.
  </p>  
  
  <p>
    I'm wondering if there is any way you could make napkins and utensils optional for online orders or 
    ask if they are needed for phone in orders. I think this would cut down a significant amount of 
    landfill waste and ultimately, cut down on your costs. 
  </p>

  <p>
    I hope you'll consider this request from a loyal customer.
  </p>

    Thank you,
  </p>
