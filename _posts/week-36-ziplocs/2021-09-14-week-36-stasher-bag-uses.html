    <p>
      This week we've taken a look at the <a href="environmental-impact-of-ziploc-bags.html" target="__blank">
      environmental impact of ZipLoc Bags</a> and dicovered that though convenient, single-use 
      plastic bags are contaminating our waterways and living in our landfills for hundreds of years.
      Fortunately, Stasher bags offer a perfect sustainable alternative. Here are a few benefits:
    </p>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Each Stasher bag has the potential to keep thousands of single-use plastic storage bags our of our landfills and waterways.</li>
        <li>Available in various colors and sizes.</li>
        <li>Completely free of BPA, BPS, lead, latex, and phalates.</li>
        <li>Microwave, oven, freezer, and dishwasher safe.</li>
        <li>Shipped without packaging waste.</li>
        <li>Made of silicone.</li>
        <li>Can be <a href="https://www.stasherbag.com/pages/repurpose-program" target="__blank">repurposed</a> into playground or trak surfaces at end of life.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      To clean your Stasher bag, simply put it in the dishwasher or hand wash with warm, soapy water. 
      It may be tempting to turn your bag inside out, but this will only degrade the strength of the bonded edges.
      If you are looking to get rid of unwanted odor, soak your Stasher bag in 50/50 solution of warm water and 
      vinegar for a few hours. And if your bag has stains, setting it in direct sunlight for a hours will
      act as a natural bleaching agent.
