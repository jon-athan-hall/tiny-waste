  <p>
    While I'm not what anyone would call a fashionista, I do enjoy the occasional shopping spree. And since 
    I loathe spending top dollar on temporary trends, I often opt for brands that offer cute clothes at an affordable price point.
    My go-to picks include H&M, TopShop, Zara, Forever 21, and Shein, which make it very easy to indulge in 
    XXXX without XXX. Unfortunately these are all considered fast fashion brands, which I now know 
    aren't exactly environmentally friendly.

  <h2>What is fast fashion?</h2>
  <p>
    Basically, fast fashion is the business model of getting trends off the runway and in stores quickly. Typically, 
    fast fashion lowers the quality of materials and production, so that products can be offered to consumers at 
    an affordable price.

  <h2>Why is fast fashion a problem?</h2>
  <p>
    According to the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/facts-and-figures-about-materials-waste-and-recycling/nondurable-goods-product-specific-data#ClothingandFootwear" target="_blank">
    EPA</a>, textiles make up nearly 8% of landfill waste. In 2018, The U.S. sent 9,070,000 tons of clothing and 
    shoes to landfills. Add towels, sheets, and pillowcases and we're at 11,000,000 tons of textile waste.

  <h2>What's the best way to get rid of my old clothes?</h2>
  <p>
    Clothing should never be thrown away. Instead, donate, recycle, or even sell your old duds to keep them 
    from ending up in a landfill. 
  </p>
  
  <h3>Donate</h3>
  <p>
    Before you donate your clothing, make sure it is still wearable. A missing button is not a big deal, but 
    giant holes and stains will often go straight to the garbage bin.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can drop off a variety of clothing to organizations like <a href="https://www.goodwill.org/" target="__blank">Goodwill</a> or <a href="https://www.salvationarmyusa.org/usn/" target="__blank">
    Salvation Army</a>. 
  </p>

  <p>
    <a href="https://dressforsuccess.org/" target="__blank">Dress for Success</a> and <a href="https://www.acdnonline.org/" target="__blank">
    Alliance for Career Development</a> accept professional attire for men and women seeking to reenter the workplace.
  </p> 

  <p>
    Children's clothing as well as stuffed animals and baby items can be cleaned and sent to <a href="https://stuffedanimalsforemergencies.org/" target="__blank">S.A.F.E - Stuffed Animals for Emergencies</a>.
  </p> 
   
  <p>
    And old kicks can be donated to an organization like <a href="https://soles4souls.org/" target="_blank">Soles4Souls</a>, which gives gently used shoes 
    to people in poverty.
  </p>

  <h3>Recycle</h3> 
  <p>
    <a href="https://www.thenorthface.com/about-us/responsibility/product/clothes-the-loop.html" target="_blank">The North Face</a>,
    <a href="https://wornwear.patagonia.com/Patagonia" target="_blank">Patagonia</a>,
    <a href="https://hmgroup.com/sustainability/circular-and-climate-positive/recycling.html" target="_blank">H&M</a>,
    <a href="https://www.levistrauss.com/2015/07/21/clothing-recycling-us-expansion/" target="_blank">Levi's</a>, and 
    <a href="https://www.madewell.com/inspo-do-well-denim-recycling-landing.html?srcCode=affiliate|Bloggers|VigLink|MWAFFI00001&
      siteId=CJ_6146840_VigLink&utm_source=VigLink&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_content=Bloggers&utm_campaign=MWAFFI00001&cjevent=4779b5f9516111eb81b900ed0a240613" target="_blank">Madewell</a> 
    all have some form of an apparel recycling program.  Sneakers can be dropped off at any <a href="https://www.nike.com/help/a/recycle-shoes" target="_blank">Nike</a> 
    location, where they will be recycled into new material. 
  </p>


  <h3>Sell</h3>
  <p>
    If you're looking to get a little cash back from your shopping habit, try selling it. Consignment shops like 
    <a href="https://www.buffaloexchange.com/" target="__blank">Buffalo Exchange</a> and <a href="https://clothesmentor.com/" target="__blank">
    Clothes Mentor</a> are nationwide chains that will sell your gently used clothing for a percentage of the profit. Or, you can 
    go through online companies like <a href="https://www.thredup.com/cleanout" target="__blank">Thredup</a> and <a href="https://poshmark.com/create-listing" target="__blank">
    Poshmark</a>. Even <a href="https://www.facebook.com" target="__blank">Facebook Marketplace</a> has
    become a convenient way to clean out your closet for a little profit.
