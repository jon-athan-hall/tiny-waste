    There are plenty of <a href="sustainable-deodorant-options.html" target="__blank">sustainable deodorant options</a> 
    available to us, but if you're on a budget, the prices might feel a little out of reach. According to an article in <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/how-advertisers-convinced-americans-they-smelled-bad-12552404/?c=y&story=fullstory" target="__blank">
    Smithsonian Magazine</a>, Americans spend $18 billion a year on deodorant. Fortunately, 
    deodorant is very easy to make at home with a few simple ingredients. You can put your deodorant into 
    a empty deodorant tube or keep it in a jar and apply with your fingers or a popsicle stick.

  <p>
    Please note that 
    if this is your first time using natural deodorant, it may take a few weeks for your body to adjust. 
    Until then, you might want to apply it multiple times throughout the day to keep your underarms smelling fresh.
